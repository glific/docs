**Keywords are used to start a particular flow from a BOT. When beneficiary sends a specific word  which is set as keyword for a flow, that particular flow will start and beneficiary will start getting messages from that flow. Multiple Keywords can be defined with a flow and in different languages. Common keywords used are _Hi_, _Hello_, _Help_, _NGO Org Name_ etc, depending on the purpose of the flow.**

## How to define a keyword

Keywords can be defined at the time of creating a flow and can also be edited at a later stage.
