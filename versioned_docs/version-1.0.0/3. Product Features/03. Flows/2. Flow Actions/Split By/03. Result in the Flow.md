**There may be situations where you would want to show different responses to different flow results. You can use the `Split by a flow result` option to Splitting the results on the basis of user responses.**



## Sample Use Case
 Suppose you have asked a question from the user and based on the result, you want to send the user different responses. `Split by flow result`will help you send different messages for their responses.

1. Get a response from the user in the flow.
