**There may be situations where you would want to show different responses on the basis of some attribute of contact (which is saved in contact variables by `Update Contact` questions type). You can use the `Split by Contact Field` option to make that happen.**

## Sample Use Case
Suppose you want to take a decision on the basis of the age group a contact belongs to. You need to save the age of the contact in the contact variable before using that in `split by a contact field`

1. Ask contact about their age group.
