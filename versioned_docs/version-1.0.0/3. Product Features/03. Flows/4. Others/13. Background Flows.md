**There may be a requirement to  send automated messages other than the regular flows they&#39;re accessing or manual interaction happening with them. Such as when you want to keep sending weekly/bi-monthly activities but also have the interact with the bot on a daily basis. For this, you can plan your activities as a background flow while other flows remain as it is.**

So, you can create that flow and mark it as  `Run this flow in the background`

Note: Background flow cannot have `wait for response` node, as this flow will execute in the background and may conflict with other flows hence, you shouldn&#39;t  expect any response from user for those.

If you need a flow with user responses, then create a normal flow and uncheck `Run this flow in the background`



## **Create Background flow**

1 . Create a flow.

2 . Configure it with messages the way you want.

### **Background flows can be used :**

- to share some messages to number of contacts from collection.
- to share any information periodically with beneficiaries combined with triggers.
- to update specific states of beneficiaries in the system. (Ex. Update district of all  beneficiaries who are in one collection.)
