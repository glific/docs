**There may be a situation, where you want to identify which keyword started a flow or wanted to capture the keyword/sentence contact has sent to start a flow.**


You can use `flow_keyword` variables to get the information in the flow.

The syntax will be `@results.flow_keyword.input`

or you can use a `category` to get the whole sentence which contact has entered to start a flow.

The syntax will be `@results.flow_keyword.category`

For Example: Let's say you have a flow with multiple keywords like **key1, key2, key3** etc and you want to know what keyword actually triggred the flow.

Note: If a staff member (User) initiates the flow for a contact from the dashboard, then @results.flow_keyword.category will either be null or return @results.flow_keyword.category as value.
