## Gupshup File Manager Links

Even if images were uploaded less than 30 days ago, Gupshup file links may not be accessible. This is due to a change by Meta:

- All media URLs now expire after 5 minutes.

- To access the media again, you need to retrieve the URL using the media ID.

- Media IDs received via webhook are only available for download for 7 days. Reference: [WhatsApp Cloud API – Media](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/cloud-api/reference/media/)

**Where to Find Your Media in Glific:**

- Glific stores media file details in BigQuery under the message media table.

- Go to BigQuery → expand your BOT number → message media table.

**There are two important columns:**

- URL – The Gupshup link (expires quickly).

- GCS_URL – Permanent path in Google Cloud Storage for the media file (remains available if GCS is enabled in Glific).
