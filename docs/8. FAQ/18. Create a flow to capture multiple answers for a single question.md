While creating a program you might have a requirement to capture multiple answers for a single question. This requirement doesn&#39;t work with interactive messages but you can still use regular text to accomplish this.



For multiple answers, it&#39;s always better to add a note and an input example that will help users to know how to answer in the correct way. For example,

And the Wait For Response can be something like this

## For Conditional Flow



If you want to create a conditional flow with multiple answers, you can create your program like this.
