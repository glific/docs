**Leverage the capabilities of GPT models developed by OpenAI by using OpenAI APIs.**

## Using ChatGPT within Glific using the OpenAI APIs

## Pre-requisites 
1. Should have acquired OpenAI platform 
2. Should have created API keys
3. Shuold have enough balance in the OpenAI account 

## How it will work 
1. Question is asked by the user
2. OpenAI API call is made using webhooks
3. The response from GPT can be printed

## Steps to follow 
1. Go to "Settings", find "OpenAI (ChatGPT) (Beta)" 
2. Click on “is active” and paste the OpenAI API key from your OpenAI platform account 

Sample flow 

3. Get the user question 
4. Use the webhook “parse_via_chat_gpt”

5. Share the following function body 
  {
  "contact": "@contact",
  "results": "@results",
  "question_text": "@results.question" 
  }
6. The response from GPT is shown as “@results.gpt_response.parsed_msg”


## Limitations 
1. At present, this is simple question answer with the GPT model 
2. Selection of GPT model being used is hardcoded 
3. Additional system prompt cannot be done
