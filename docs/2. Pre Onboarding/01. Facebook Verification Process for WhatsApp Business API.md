### Introduction: 

Before any organisation can use WhatsApp Business API with Glific, must complete Facebook Business Manager Verification and Gupshup setup.

### What is Business Verification and Why it is needed ?

Business verification ensures that a Business Manager account is associated with a genuine business or organization. It’s required to comply with Meta’s policies, maintain brand consistency (your Page, domain, and documents must match), avoid delays during chatbot onboarding, and unlock higher messaging limits and template approvals.

Gupshup acts as a WhatsApp Business API provider that enables seamless messaging between NGOs and their users. 
While Facebook (Meta) provides the underlying WhatsApp API, Gupshup manages essential aspects such as message routing, template approvals, and ensuring reliable delivery. 
It also simplifies integration with platforms like Glific by handling the technical complexities of WhatsApp’s API, ensuring scalability, compliance, and uninterrupted message flow. 
This is why both Facebook and Gupshup are required for effective chatbot communication.

**This process verifies two key aspects:**

- To verify the legal name of the business
- To verify the legal address or phone number 
(Note: The phone number should not be linked to a WhatsApp account)
You will have to upload the official documents to prove your business is registered. Facebook Business Manager takes a maximum of 3-4 working days to get verified by Meta

### Prerequisites:

 Before starting, ensure you have the following 4 things ready:
 
 - A [Facebook Business Manager account](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/1710077379203657?id=180505742745347)

- A Facebook Page linked to your organisation with admin access. (Important: This is separate from the Business Manager; both are needed.)

- Official legal documents of your organisation:

- Registration certificate / incorporation documents - Required to verify the registered name and branding

- Utility bill (Electricity bill/Internet/Mobile bill) or bank statement showing legal address -- Required to verify the name of the organization, the address, and phone number i.e (BOT number). If the BOT number is not available. Please match the exact address

- Phone number on which you would like to run the chatbot Make sure that this phone number should not be associated with WhatsApp Business or WhatsApp application. Needs to be active for the use so that you can get sms/call for verification. It could be running on a basic monthly plan.

### What is Branding Consistency ?

For smooth FB verification to happen, it is very important for your organization branding to be consistent with your registered entity name. Here are a few guidelines/workaround for the same-

1) Your Facebook page and domain name should be exactly the same or close to the registered business name. If that's not the case, For eg- 
   Glific Two-Way Communication Inc. is the registered name but the Facebook page name is Glific, and the website is www.glific.org, and email 
   id is info@glific.org, then you would need to explicitly mention on your website about page that "Your organization name is Glific Two-Way 
   Communication Inc. but popularly goes by the brand Glific". You may add it in any words you'd like but it needs to be very clearly 
   mentioned.

2) This applies also to cases where you may have subsidiary programs such as Chat for change is the program by Glific which has an FB page, 
   website, etc…but the registration certificate is in the name of Glific Two-Way Communication Inc. You would need to get approval for the 
   registered business entity.

3) Once this is done, you can give a specific display name to the chatbot which is relevant to the program and not the main entity. So, the 
   chatbot name can be Chat for change but again, it should show a clear connection with the main entity Glific Two-Way Communication.

4) Since you may also need to later verify your domain(website) you need access to your website codebase or have a valid email id for the 
   domain such as info@domain.com
