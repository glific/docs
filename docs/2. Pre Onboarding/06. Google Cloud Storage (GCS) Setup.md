**Google Cloud Storage (GCS) is a cloud-based service provided by Google Cloud Platform (GCP) that allows you to store and access data—such as files, images, videos, backups, and large datasets—on Google’s secure servers instead of on your local computer or server.**
**Google Cloud Storage (GCS) will be used for various purposes like storing data for reporting via BigQuery as well as for storing media files.**

### Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you have:

- A Google account (preferably linked to your organisation).

- A valid phone number and payment details for Google Cloud billing.

- Legal documents of your for verification.

### Setup

**The overall setup includes:**

Create Google Cloud Account → Enable Billing → Create Project → Enable APIs→ Create Storage Bucket → Add Service Account Key → Link with Glific

### Step 1: Create a Google Cloud Account

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com) and sign in with your Gsuite account.

### What's the reason for setting the GCS bucket to public?

The `GCS (Google Cloud Storage)` bucket is set to public to make it easier to share files—like PDFs, images, videos etc — without needing user authentication. 

This is especially useful when files need to be accessed directly through chatbot flows or shared publicly with partners and beneficiaries.
When a file is public, anyone with the link can open or download it without logging in. This avoids errors or delays caused by restricted access.

Example:

If an NGO’s bot sends a PDF through a the chatbot, and the file is stored in a public bucket, the end user can simply tap the link and view it — no login or permission required.
Note: Only non-sensitive, public-facing files should be stored in the public bucket. Private or personal data should always be stored securely with proper access controls.

### Is it possible to keep my GCS bucket private instead of making it public?

It's perfectly fine to keep your `GCS bucket` private as long as you don't plan to share any content publicly.

However, if you need to send media as attachments (instead of sharing via links), the bucket would need to be public for access.

Also, just to clarify — `BigQuery tables` and `GCS buckets` serve different purposes.

- BigQuery tables are used to store structured data (like databases).
- GCS buckets are used to store media files such as images, audio, and documents.

### Assign access to the Service Account in Google Console

- Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com) and sign in with your Gsuite account.
