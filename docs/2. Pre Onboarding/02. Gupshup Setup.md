###  Introduction

Gupshup is the official WhatsApp Business API provider (BSP) used by Glific. All WhatsApp communication for your chatbot flows through Gupshup’s platform.
Gupshup setup is required for the below resons: 
- Meta (Facebook) mandates that businesses connect through a verified BSP.
- Gupshup provides the interface for creating a WhatsApp Business Account (WABA), managing templates, and ensuring compliance.
- Without completing the Gupshup setup, your chatbot cannot go live on WhatsApp.


### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:
- [Facebook verification process for WA business API](https://glific.github.io/docs/docs/Pre%20Onboarding/Facebook%20Verification%20Process%20for%20WhatsApp%20Business%20API)

- A new phone number or a phone number that hasn’t been used with WhatsApp. The sim card should be activated with a minimal plan so as to receive sms verification code/call from Gupshup

- To dis-associate your phone number from WhatsApp you need to open WhatsApp on your phone. 
 Go to Settings → Account → Delete my account.
 
Note - simply uninstalling the app **does not** remove the association between the phone number and WhatsApp.

### Process Overview

Here’s a quick look at the steps you will complete:

27. Please refer to [add display picture ](https://docs.gupshup.io/docs/profile)

28. Then go to the Security Centre page on `Facebook business manager`. You should find the `start verification` button activated. In case it doesn&#39;t get activated instantly, you may give it some time. If it&#39;s taking longer than a few hours, contact us.



29. If you still don&#39;t see or get access to `start verification`, go to News Pages in your business manager, add your page and then click on verify your business.



30. The process is straightforward after that. You will be required to verify your business by uploading some documents.


31. As the doc will mention, using `Certificate of registration` is highly recommended to not get the approval process rejected. _Please make sure your provided business details exactly match with the detail in the document._


32. Once done, Facebook will take 3-4 working days to review and you will receive an email once this is done. The button in the Security Centre will also have changed. Please reach out to us in case it&#39;s taking more than a week. We&#39;ll reach out to FB to expedite the process.
