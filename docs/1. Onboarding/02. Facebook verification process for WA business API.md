1. Create your Facebook managerÂ or claim it for an existing page [https://www.facebook.com/business/help/1710077379203657?id=180505742745347](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/1710077379203657?id=180505742745347)
2. Please note a few things before you begin the process. **Important**!
   1. Your branding should be consistent with your registered entity name. Your Facebook page and domain name should be exactly the same or close to the registered business name.
   1. If that&#39;s not the case, eg. Glific Two-Way Communication Inc. is the registered name but the Facebook page name is Glific, and the website is `www.glific.org`, and so are the emails `info@glific.org`, you would need to explicitly mention on your website about page that &quot;Your organisation name is Glific Two-Way Communication Inc. but popularly goes by the brand Glific&quot;.
   1. You may add it in any words you&#39;d like but it needs to be very clearly mentioned.
   1. This applies also to cases where you may have subsidiary programs such as `Chat for change` is the program by Glific which has an FB page, website, etcâ€¦but the registration certificate is in the name of Glific Two-Way Communication Inc. You would need to get approval for the registered business entity.
   1. Once this is done, you can give a specific display name to the chatbot which is relevant to the program and not the main entity. So, the chatbot name can be Chat for change but again, it should show a clear connection with the main entity Glific Two-Way Communication.
   1. Since you may also need to later verify your domain(website) you need access to your website codebase or have a valid email id for the domain such as info@domain.com
   1. You also need some ðŸ“„ **documents for verification**
      1. Registration certification, to verify the registered name and branding
      1. Utility bill to verify the name of the organisation, the address, and phone number
      1. Bank statement, to verify the org name and address proof
   1. Please also have a **phone number ready** on which you&#39;d like to run your chatbot.
      1. ðŸš¨This phone number should not be associated with WhatsApp Business or WhatsApp application.
      1. It could be running on a basic monthly plan. It just needs to be active for the use so that you can get sms/call for verification.
3. If you need help with any of the above, reach out to us. If you&#39;re A-ok with the above, let&#39;s move forward. Next, you need to go to [Business Manager](https://business.facebook.com/settings/) and follow the steps below -
