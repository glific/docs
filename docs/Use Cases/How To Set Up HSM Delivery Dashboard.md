### Problem: How to find the number of contacts who did not get the business initiated message due to frequency capping regulations imposed by Meta on Marketing HSMs.

Context: Meta recently introduced something called as Frequency capping. Explaining in a simple manner, it noticed that users get a lot of Marketing messages from businesses, and to limit SPAM daily, it restricts how many Marketing messages a user can get during a rolling period of X days.

To prevent misuse and gaming the system, they haven’t told us how many messages are allowed in how many days. You can read more about this in their own words [here.](https://www.gupshup.io/resources/blog/all-you-need-to-know-about-whatsapp-business-api-frequency-capping)

### Solution: To understand contacts, templates, and campaigns affected (based on dates the broadcast was initaited) by having information of errors that were encountered visialized on a lookerstudio dashboard. This will reduce the effort in repeteadly quering this infomration from the database for every braodcast made, and to make this information easily accessible to the program / operations team to work with.

```
SELECT
JSON_EXTRACT_SCALAR(m.errors, '$.app') AS app,
JSON_EXTRACT_SCALAR(m.errors, '$.payload.destination') AS destination,
STRING_AGG(cc.group_name, ', ') AS group_names,
JSON_EXTRACT_SCALAR(m.errors, '$.payload.type') AS type,
JSON_EXTRACT_SCALAR(m.errors, '$.payload.payload.reason') AS reason,
DATE(m.sent_at) AS sent_on,
m.flow_name AS flow_name,
m.template_uuid AS template_id,
m.body AS message,
m.media_url,
m.is_hsm,
m.contact_name,
m.contact_phone
FROM `tides-saas-309509.918657048982.messages` AS m
JOIN `tides-saas-309509.918657048982.contact_collection` AS cc
ON JSON_EXTRACT_SCALAR(m.errors, '$.payload.destination') = cc.phone
WHERE m.bsp_status = "error"
GROUP BY
app, destination, type, reason, sent_on, flow_name, template_id, message, m.media_url, m.is_hsm, m.contact_name, m.contact_phone;

```
- In the above query two tables are being merged - `contact_collection` and `messages`. 
- For this query to work for your organization, reaplce the 'projet-name' with the name of your Google Cloud project within which the Big Qusery instance is set up.
- Replace the 'bot-number' with the chatbot number being used, pre-fixed with the country code.

## How to set this up  

### 1. Sign into Bigquery using the appropriate email account and select the options to run a query.  
- Navigate to bigquery. Expand the phone number (aka dataset) and select `Contacts` table

- Click on the “Query’ button to create an empty query

- You will get an empty query which looks like this

- Copy paste the query above into the query window. Replace the phrase “dataset” with the values from the empty query. Copy everything (projectname.dataset) from the ‘ symbol till the .(dot) before contacts and paste it in the 2 places it says “dataset”. Delete the empty query so that only what you pasted is visible on the screen.
  
- Hit the ‘Run’ button. You will see Query Results coming once the query has run

- You will now see a new table/view popping up in the list of tables in the left of the screen
