# Requirements
To be a part of Glific pilot you’ll need these things:

1. **Facebook page** of your organization for **Facebook Business Manager Verification**
1. A **phone number** to be used for **Whatsapp Chatbot**
1. **There is a monthly fee of INR 9,500 for the platform usage and a one-time setup cost of INR 15,000 for initial consulting/training/customizations.** 
(The fee  covers our operational expenses and platform costs. Messaging costs are additional and will be paid via credit card directly to Gupshup - all pricing details here.  Platform development and enhancement costs are borne by philanthropic funding.)
1. **Your use case and how you plan to use it. For what programs, the scale, etc…**
(The reason is that once the NGOs identified the process and have documented how communications will happen at their organisations, it will be easier to apply Glific or any relevant software solution for that. Identifying and refining the process is key and super important.)  
1. **Your proposed workflow:** [**Example 1**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jQcSOLfASa_RR7f_JlZd7WT2INaSC9tTQCNdWI_EOOw/edit)**,** [**Example 2**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WxIWityZm3rEuQKM5m2U81gA7EhNgKrj/edit)

(This a sample flow for ideas, your proposed workflow should be different from the example.)
1. **Details and description of any previous pilot experiments(with 10-50 users)** 
(Your NGO has done using your personal WhatsApp account.  This gives you a better idea of how you might want to structure the interaction, to begin with.)
1. [Knowledge of WhatsApp Ecosystem](https://glific.org/7-things-you-must-know-about-using-whatsapp-chatbot/ )

# Additional Pointers

These additional pointers may help you with the planning and piloting. The pilot can help you discover:

- How similar or different are the questions asked by your beneficiaries
- Identify a pattern in conversations
- Try a question-answer process with at least 20 beneficiaries
- Create an FAQ database based on your conversations
- Create a set of data points you generally need to collect
- [India Literacy Project Use Case Study](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YnCnzfjxwPfOirJSgTE6_BQxkTpPKxbP_hP_6zXkNFY/edit), [Antarang Use case](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jQcSOLfASa_RR7f_JlZd7WT2INaSC9tTQCNdWI_EOOw/edit?ts=5fe42228)
