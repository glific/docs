<img width="759" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/feaa89b2-907d-4797-ab55-c9e9d3682ba8" />

- Navigate to `Brand Safety and Suitability

- Under this section, you should find an option for `Domain` 
    
- Click on `Add a domain`
![image3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/143380171/274577857-73abca95-625f-484b-8fe6-96880aa45b23.png)

- Select `request access to your domain`

- You will get three options for how to verify your domain.

1) Adding a TXT record to your DNS
2) Uploading an HTML file to your server
3) Placing an HTML script on the homepage of your website.

- The first option is easy if you have access to your cpanel.

- Facebook will provide you with a DNS verification that you need to complete to verify that you own the domain.

- You can add a TXT Record through the cpanel of your hosting provider.

- This is done by logging into your hosting provider, going to your DNS Manager and clicking on `add TXT record`.

- If that’s too much go with option 3: `meta-tag verification`.

- You just copy and paste a small bit of code to your home page by clicking the `meta-tag verification` menu option there in the top right.

- With this method all you need is access to your website and place that the same place you have other tags like Google Tag Manager.

## Additional Notes on Adding a Domain:

When adding a domain, only include the domain name itself without "www." at the beginning. For example, if your domain is 
"www.example.org," you should enter it as "example.org."

## What is Business Verification ?

Business verification ensures that a Business Manager account is associated with a  genuine  business or organization. 

This process verifies two key aspects:

- To verify the legal name of the business
- To verify the legal address or phone number (Note: The phone number should not be linked to a WhatsApp account).

You will have to upload the official documents to prove your business is registered. Facebook Business Manager takes a maximum of 3-4 working days to get verified by Meta.


## Which documents are accepted for Facebook Business Verification?

- Certificate/Articles of incorporation
- Business registration or license document
- Government-issued business tax document
- Business bank statement
- Utility bill

## Branding Consistency

For smooth FB verification to happen, it is very important for your organization branding to be consistent with your registered entity name. Here are a few guidelines/workaround for the same-

1) Your Facebook page and domain name should be exactly the same or close to the registered business name. If that's not the case, For eg- 
   Glific Two-Way Communication Inc. is the registered name but the Facebook page name is Glific, and the website is www.glific.org, and email 
   id is info@glific.org, then you would need to explicitly mention on your website about page that "Your organization name is Glific Two-Way 
   Communication Inc. but popularly goes by the brand Glific". You may add it in any words you'd like but it needs to be very clearly 
   mentioned.

2) This applies also to cases where you may have subsidiary programs such as Chat for change is the program by Glific which has an FB page, 
   website, etc…but the registration certificate is in the name of Glific Two-Way Communication Inc. You would need to get approval for the 
   registered business entity.

3) Once this is done, you can give a specific display name to the chatbot which is relevant to the program and not the main entity. So, the 
   chatbot name can be Chat for change but again, it should show a clear connection with the main entity Glific Two-Way Communication.

4) Since you may also need to later verify your domain(website) you need access to your website codebase or have a valid email id for the 
   domain such as info@domain.com


## Things to keep ready before Facebook Verification:

Below are the 4 things you need to keep handy before you start FB verification, as you would need to add these details at different points in verification.

1) Registration certification- Required to verify the registered name and branding (you can read more about this in next session)

2) Utility bill (Electricity bill/Internet/Mobile bill)- Required to verify the name of the organization, the address, and phone number i.e 
   (BOT number). If the BOT number  is not available. Please match the exact address

3) Bank statement- Required to verify the organization name and address.

4) Phone number on which you would like to run the chatbot
   Make sure that this phone number should not be associated with WhatsApp Business or WhatsApp application.
   Needs to be active for the use so that you can get sms/call for verification. It could be running on a basic monthly plan.

## Steps to complete Facebook Verification Process:

1) Log in using a `Facebook` account connected to your `Business Page`.

2) Access `Meta Business Suite` 

<img width="850" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/74a63ea5-872a-4e9b-a1cc-38818eb8f8b1" />

4) Choose your business name from the dropdown.

5) Click on `Settings` sign right to your bussniess name.

6) If the settings icon isn’t visible, it’s likely that you don’t have a `business portfolio` yet. In that case, click on `Create Business Portfolio`.

<img width="398" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fd057f17-89df-4a2a-828f-d90c0c169ef8" />

8) Navigate to `Business Setting`: Inside the Settings, locate and click on `Business Setting`

<img width="573" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3760cb4b-f12e-4067-b7f6-9cc1eaf20dcf" />

11) Sometimes, the ‘Start Verification’ button may be grayed out or show as Ineligible for Verification. In such cases, you'll need to create an account on Gupshup and complete a few steps. Once the Gupshup app goes live, return to the Facebook page, and the Start Verification button will be enabled. If it was previously marked as Ineligible, it will change to Start Verification.
