<h5>Things to keep ready before Facebook Verification-</h5>
Below are the 4 things you need to keep handy before you start FB verification, as you would need to add these details at different points in verification.

1) Registration certification- Required to verify the registered name and branding (you can read more about this in next session)

2) Utility bill (Electricity bill/Internet/Mobile bill)- Required to verify the name of the organization, the address, and phone number i.e 
   (BOT number). If the BOT number  is not available. Please match the exact address

3) Bank statement- Required to verify the organization name and address.

4) Phone number on which you would like to run the chatbot
   Make sure that this phone number should not be associated with WhatsApp Business or WhatsApp application.
   Needs to be active for the use so that you can get sms/call for verification. It could be running on a basic monthly plan.

## Creation of FB Business Manager

Create your Facebook Manager or claim it for an existing page : Click here to know how [Create a Business 
  Manager
](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/1710077379203657?id=180505742745347)

## Branding Consistency

For smooth FB verification to happen, it is very important for your organization branding to be consistent with your registered entity name. Here are a few guidelines/workaround for the same-

1) Your Facebook page and domain name should be exactly the same or close to the registered business name. If that's not the case, For eg- 
   Glific Two-Way Communication Inc. is the registered name but the Facebook page name is Glific, and the website is www.glific.org, and email 
   id is info@glific.org, then you would need to explicitly mention on your website about page that "Your organization name is Glific Two-Way 
   Communication Inc. but popularly goes by the brand Glific". You may add it in any words you'd like but it needs to be very clearly 
   mentioned.

2) This applies also to cases where you may have subsidiary programs such as Chat for change is the program by Glific which has an FB page, 
   website, etc…but the registration certificate is in the name of Glific Two-Way Communication Inc. You would need to get approval for the 
   registered business entity.

3) Once this is done, you can give a specific display name to the chatbot which is relevant to the program and not the main entity. So, the 
   chatbot name can be Chat for change but again, it should show a clear connection with the main entity Glific Two-Way Communication.

4) Since you may also need to later verify your domain(website) you need access to your website codebase or have a valid email id for the 
   domain such as info@domain.com
