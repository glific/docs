## Deduction Type of Messages on the WhatsApp Business Platform.

WhatsApp implements a billing model based on conversations rather than individual messages.A conversation refers to a continuous exchange of messages within a 24-hour period between the BOT and the end-user.
Charges are incurred when messages sent by the BOT are successfully delivered to the end user.

##Conversation Categories

**Utility** — Enables you to follow up on user actions or requests. Examples include opt-in confirmation, order/delivery management (e.g., delivery update); account updates or alerts (e.g., payment reminder); or feedback surveys.
 
**Authentication** — This enables you to authenticate users with one-time passcodes, potentially at multiple steps in the login process (e.g., account verification, account recovery, integrity challenges).
Service — Enables you to resolve customer inquiries.
 
Marketing, utility, and authentication conversations can only be opened with template messages. Service conversations can only be opened with free-form messages. https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/pricing#opening-conversations
