## Adding new contacts to your Glific account
This feature enables NGO staff to upload a large number of new contacts into their Glific account and mark them opt-in contacts. Doing this will enable NGOs to initiate the first message to these contacts.

### Before uploading new contacts: 
1. Ensure you have prior permission / consent from the contacts to message them through the chatbot.
2. Ensure the first message being sent to the newly onboarded contacts is the opt-in message 

### Note
1. Contacts get an option to “block or report” a chatbot number when the business initiates the first conversation. 
2. More no of contacts blocking a chatbot for a given message can lead to the reduction in quality rating of the chatbot or sometimes permanent suspension of the chatbot accoun.
3. Kindly plan to message large number of new contacts in batches to avoid having quality rating of your chatbot reduced or having your chatbot blocked by Meta

### How to use
1. Go to `Manage` and `Contacts` 
2. Find the `Import contacts` and click `Continue`

1. Ensure that the country code is present in the phone number.
2. This feature uploads all the contacts into the platform and does not validate the phone number (if it is less than 10 digits or if the number exists on WhatsApp or no). Any invalid number which gets added, when broadcasted to will not get the message.
3. Language field is to provide the language preference. Leaving it blank will cause the language preference to be the default language selected in the org’s Glific platform
