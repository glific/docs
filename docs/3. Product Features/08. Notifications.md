## Notifications for System Errors

Check the notifications tab to know if there&#39;s any error while executing the flow or any other parts of the application.**

1 . Click on `Notifications`  tab from the `Left Panel`.

<br />

4 . Click on `Critical` checkbox to view the Critical errors or click on `Warning` checkbox to view the warning errors. Critical errors need more urgent attention than the warnings, so you may want to keep a tab on those.
