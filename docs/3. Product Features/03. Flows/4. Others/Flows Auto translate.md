**Allows Glific to auto translate content in the default language of flow editor, and have the translations populated in in the other languages enabled in the Glific instance.**

The feature is in beta version and can be enabled/ disabled for any given organizationâ€™s Glific instance upon request in the [discord](https://discord.gg/CAUgdQsZAd) channel or via writing to spoc from the Glific team.

**Overview**

1. Create flow in default language
2. Have translations auto populated for all the languages selected in your Glific instance
3. Have the flow exported as CSV (with or without translations) to be proofread and corrected by language experts
4. Import translations as CSV
5. The process (automatic translations -> export translations -> import translations) chain can be used as a whole or in parts depending on your needs
