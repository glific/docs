To update consent status on any user,Update Contact→Settings—>Optin/ Optout in the flow.
A dropdown named `Consent status` (replacing "Settings") which will further give you 2 options as a dropdown- Opt In & Opt Out. Functionality at the backend remains the same.

Please note- There wouldn’t be any issues in the flows in which you updated the consent status using “Settings” earlier. It will work fine without any issues.

## Opt-out preferences update

5 .  Create a flow for opt-out or use the existing flow in the system. Keywords for Optout flow could be  **optout**, **stop.** _(You can recommend us if you have better suggestions for the keywords)_

6 .  When beneficiary sends    **optout** or **stop**  keyword to BOT, Opt-out preferences will be set for the beneficiary.

7 . Yon need use **optout** value to update the `Consent status` variable .




**Note** - Make sure to use optin as keyword of this flow. optin is a special keyword which will execute the flow to get contact&#39;s optin even if they are optedout
