**Support tickets streamline the process of submitting queries and assigning staff members for each query. This provides a convenient system for organizing and managing inquiries in a more efficient way.**

## Sample Use Case

 1. Here's a sample flow with minimal configuration for using the ticketing system in Glific

![flow](https://github.com/glific/docs/assets/40158831/defba88d-21d3-414a-822c-0eed3754fe18)

___

2. The first node is the `Send Message` node, which prompts the contact to share his query so a new ticket can be opened

___

3. The second node is the `Wait for Response` node with the result name `ticket`. The response from the contact will be saved in this result and can be referenced as `@results.ticket`.

___

4. The third node is `Open ticket` node which is used to create a new ticket from flow
    1. Choose `Open a ticket with a human agent` from the dropdown in node action.
    1. There we can add the labels like `registration`, `help`, `activity` to help in streamlining open tickets based on labels
    1. Choose the appropriate `staff member` to resolve that query.
    1. At last is the ticket body, here we are using the `@results.ticket` from the previous step(step 1)

# View Support Ticket Inquiries

1. To view `support tickets`, navigate to the `Support Tickets` section by hovering over `Flows` in the left panel and selecting it. In this screen, you can see all the tickets, their status, and assigned staff members. Here's how the page would look like:
   
<img width="1213" alt="Screenshot 2023-12-18 at 5 24 20 PM" src="https://gist.github.com/assets/132430123/0447e732-0bc6-47c9-ba09-72b36946b93b"/>

There are seven columns in the Tickets screen namely:

`ID:` All the tickets are mapped to a unique ID, which is the first column in the ‘Tickets’ page. This ID could be used for referring to tickets easily and is particularly useful when there are multiple team members working with the ticketing system. Sorting of tickets could be done using 'ID' by clicking the arrow towards its right-side.

`CREATED AT:` It is a time stamp represenrting the ticket creation date & time. Sorting of tickets could be done using 'Created At' by clicking the arrow towards its right-side.

`ISSUE:` Displays the posted queries. Sorting of tickets could be done using 'Issue' by clicking the arrow towards its right-side.

`OPENED BY:` Indicates who opened the ticket.

`STATUS:` Shows whether the ticket is `open` or `closed`.

`ASSIGNED TO:` Specifies the staff member assigned to the ticket.

`ACTIONS:` Provides options to add remarks, change the assignee or status of the ticket. Actions also include a 'Send message' which can be used for navigating to the exact point in chat where the ticket was created. This enables you to easily navigate to the part of the conversation where the ticket creation happened. This helps in avoiding the manual scroll required for identifying the exact location of the chat where the query was raised by a user. It also helps with more context regarding the intent of the user for raising the query.

### Bulk Update
- Updating the status of the tickets could be updated together or in bulk by using the ‘Bulk Update’ option on the top right corner of ‘Tickets’ page

- You can close all the tickets from a particular ‘Topic’ together by clicking on the ‘Close Tickets’ button. This will be particularly useful when you deal with tickets from a particular topic together and reduces the manual effort required for opening every ticket and closing them one by one.

### Search & Filter

Searching for an individual ticket or group of tickets can be done using : 
a. Body of the ticket
b. Phone number of the user
c. Name of the user

This search could be used for easily segregating tickets based on a user or the type of  query. By searching using a phone number or name, you will be able to view all the tickets raised by a particular user. Likewise, by searching for a particular keyword inside the body, you will be able to view all the tickets which have the same keyword. In this way, the support person will be able to handle similar queries & queries from the same user together. The enhanced search also enables the support person to prioritize/ de-prioritize the tickets based on a user or query type.

### Add Remarks

Once a ticket is created, users can make edits by utilizing the `Add Remark` option. These features allow for easy ticket management and efficient resolution.
