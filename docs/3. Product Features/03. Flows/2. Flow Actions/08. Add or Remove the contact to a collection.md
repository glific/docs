**`Collections` will help to group contacts based on their specific criteria or location to enable targeted campaigns, surveys, or follow-ups.**

**The `Add to Collection` and `Remove from Collection` actions in a flow automatically include or exclude contacts from a collection as they move through the flow. For detailed guidance, refer to the complete [documentation](https://glific.github.io/docs/docs/Product%20Features/Others/Collections/) on `Collections`.**

**Examples:**

- Add to Collection: When a contact provides consent to receive future messages, the contact can be added to an Opt-in collection.
If a contact shares a location preference, such as Maharashtra, the contact can be added to a Maharashtra collection.

- Remove from Collection: When a contact completes a feedback survey or an activity for a specific week or month, the contact can be removed from the Feedback  collection.

### What Happens When the Same User Passes Through This Node Again?

If a user passes through the Add to Collection node again in the same or another flow, they will not be added twice to the collection. Each contact can appear only once in a collection.

### How to Verify If the Contact Was Added to the Collection

1) Go to the left panel in the Glific Platform  Manage >> Collections page from the left menu.

2) Search for the collection name you used in the flow.

3) Click on the collection and you will see the list of contacts who have been added to it.

## Remove the contact from a Collection

**Removing contacts from a collection is useful when they no longer meet the criteria for being in that group.
 For example: If someone cancels their registration for an event, you can remove them from the “Registered Participants” collection.**

### How to Remove a Contact from a Collection

1. In your flow, click on the red dot under a node and search for the node to “remove the  contact from a collection” when you want the contact to be removed from the collection.

2.  Select the collection name from the drop down.

3. You can also check the box remove from all this action will remove the contacts from all the collections where it has been added.

4.  Click on ok and publish your flow.
