**Glific introduces multiple profiles, enabling efficient and personalized engagement with beneficiaries where a single phone number is used by multiple end users.  In this way, by segregating a single contact at the profile level, NGOs can significantly increase the impact of their work.**

___
## Sample Use Case

To achieve the multiple profiles feature, We added a new node called` Manage profile` with two choices at the flow level.

1. `Create Profile` creates a new profile for contact.
1. `Switch Profile` allows you to change between profiles.
2. `Deactivate Profile` enables the user to deactivate a profile associated with a contact, for the case where multiple profiles have been created for a contact.


# Create Profile
1.  Here's a sample flow with minimal configuration for creating a profile in Glific

2. The initial node is the `Send Message` node, where the contact is prompted to provide their details such as name, role, or age to create the profile

![2](https://github.com/glific/docs/assets/90472056/5cb5141a-8452-4966-a57b-f788e4617973)

3. The second node is the `Wait for Response` node with the result name `demo_username`. The response from the contact will be saved in this result and can be referenced as `@results.demo_username`.

![3](https://github.com/glific/docs/assets/90472056/ae24afad-bf49-4066-a2aa-c977d54b2f88)

4. The third node is the `Interactive Message`, the user is presented with options to select their role, in the below sample case we have given the option to choose the role as student or teacher.
![4](https://github.com/glific/docs/assets/90472056/7eb71142-f078-4712-a555-303811b46b00)

5. Using the user information provided, the `Manage profile` node will create a user profile, and the relevant data will be saved in the result variables, accessible as `@results.demo_username` and `@results.demo_role` for future reference.

![5](https://github.com/glific/docs/assets/90472056/50632c81-d701-4e3f-8462-de5e8135d539)

Please note - This feature does not allow the creation of duplicate profiles. Attempting to create a profile with the same name and type as an existing one will result in an error.

6. Finally, the `Update Contact` node will update the contact with the relevant contact variables.

![6](https://github.com/glific/docs/assets/90472056/3352a26c-d473-4411-baff-c02273bd3bf8)

7. Upon profile creation, a message will be sent using the `Send Message` node, notifying the contact that "your user profile has been successfully created!"

# Switch Profile

1.  Here's a sample flow with minimal configuration for the switch Profile profile in Glific

![A](https://github.com/glific/docs/assets/90472056/a28c9453-948e-4399-a205-8414e7bb84ee)

2. The first node is the `Send Message` facilitates users in switching between different profiles by using the `@contact.list_profiles` to display all available user profiles.

![B](https://github.com/glific/docs/assets/90472056/858acf8d-a009-4a2e-9a31-9ac253337cb4)

Here's how the contacts will look like:

3.  The second node is the `Wait for Response` node where each profile will be numbered. The response from the contact will be saved in the result and can be referenced as `@results.profile_index`

![c](https://github.com/glific/docs/assets/90472056/ecac5c43-188b-4fa1-bab9-fa17b1aaf444)

4. We'll use the `Manage Profile` node to switch the user profile based on their response, using the `@results.profile_index`.

![photo](https://github.com/glific/docs/assets/90472056/67a91eff-ee57-4965-94c4-ab9d25b20ef4)

5. Once the switch is completed successfully, a message will be sent to the contacts using the `Send Message` node, notifying them that their profile has been successfully switched to` @contact.fields.demo_username`.

# Deactivate Profile

### Key points to note -

- Deactivation: This feature deactivates a user profile, removing it from the UI and `@contact.list_profiles`. While the profile and its flow history are no longer visible, all details are stored in the BQ database for future retrieval.
  
Before deactivation of profile_name: test_profile_1

After deactivation of profile_name: test_profile_1

<img width="1200" height="600" alt="Screenshot 2025-06-30 at 5 59 29 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7580446d-3f04-4380-9804-954a385d5f37" />

- This feature does not support the deactivation of the default profile. All other profiles associated with the contact, except the default profile, can be deactivated.
  
- This feature can be enabled for the organization upon request. Reach out to the Glific Team over [discord](https://discord.gg/47mGc5PrZJ) 

1. Here's a sample flow with minimal configuration for deactivating a profile in Glific.

<img width="1200" height="600" alt="Screenshot 2025-06-30 at 4 01 28 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6f69ecea-f790-4390-899e-49e0fdbb504a" />

2. The first node is `Send Message` which provides the users with a list of profiles using the `@contact.list_profiles` to display all available user profiles associated with the contact.

<img width="1200" height="600" alt="Screenshot 2025-06-30 at 4 26 50 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b53b28ba-5d10-4cf2-bfd2-c00450c47818" />

Here is the list of contacts before deactivating any profile(s):

3. The second node is the `Wait for Response` node where each profile will be numbered. The response from the contact will be saved in the result which can be referenced as `@results.profile_index_2`

<img width="1200" height="600" alt="Screenshot 2025-06-30 at 4 28 43 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7c86596e-960f-4d0a-8dcc-f5f7f4a188a5" />

4. We will then use the `Manage Profile` node to deactivate the user profile based on their response, using the `@results.profile_index_2`

<img width="1200" height="600" alt="Screenshot 2025-06-30 at 4 29 53 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d8aac87a-8cbb-4986-a72d-baae0e6bedfb" />


5. Once the deactivation  is completed successfully, a message will be sent to the contacts using the `Send Message` node, presenting the list of all the current user profiles using `@contact.list_profiles` associated with the contact, post the deactivation of the selected profile.

<img width="1200" height="600" alt="Screenshot 2025-06-30 at 4 30 21 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/21b3496c-1388-4b4e-9718-e83df754c0dd" />


Here is the list of contacts after deactivating tanu123’s profile:

## Upcoming Features-

1. Visual Cues for Profile Identification in Profile Listing View.
This feature introduces visual indicators in the profile listing view, allowing users to easily distinguish between the **current active profile** and the **default profile** for a contact with multiple profiles. 

      a. Current Active Profile: Refers to the profile the contact is currently switched into from their list of associated profiles.

      b. Default Profile: The original/first profile created for the contact. It acts as the primary profile upon which additional profiles are built.

2. Contact Deletion as a Consequence of Default Profile Deletion.
Since the default profile of a contact is treated as the 'primary profile', using this feature – if the user opts to delete the default profile, it would result in the contact being deleted. This action will require explicit user confirmation, as it is irreversible.
