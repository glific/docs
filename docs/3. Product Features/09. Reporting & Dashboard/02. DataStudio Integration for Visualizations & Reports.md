### Connect `flat fields`, `monthly active users`, `Contact collections`, `success messages` and `flow context` by replacing your Dataset ID into the preset 'Custom Query'.

---

8 . For the Flat Fields data source, select Edit and then update the custom query with **Dataset ID** (from the Glific settings interface for big query as shown in the note above). Replace `tides-saas-309509.917302307943` with your **Dataset ID** (Refer to the image below)

**Note:** Ensure that you only replace the **Dataset ID**, that is, ".contacts" should not be deleted. This applies for all steps where you replace the **Dataset ID**, ensure you do not select and paste over the remaining text.

10 . Verify the field types. (Refer Step 6.f.) And then click `Done`

11 . Follow steps 8 to 10 as above for; `Monthly active users`, `Contact Collections` and `Success Messages`, Replace the **Dataset ID** as per your setup.

12 . For Flow context data source update the custom query with **Dataset ID** (from the Glific settings interface for big query). There will be four places where you need to update the **Dataset ID**

---

### Connect `flow Results` and `Contact Collection` by running a query in BigQuery before connecting the data sources.

---

13 . For Flow results. First go to your BigQuery account. Open a new tab and run below query. Replace `tides-saas-309509.917302307943` with your **Dataset ID**

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32592458/212663971-569e3848-7a8a-44ff-813a-f044962c3397.png)

```
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION `tides-saas-309509.917302307943.jsonObjectKeys`(input STRING) RETURNS ARRAY<STRING> LANGUAGE js AS R"""
const inputJson=JSON.parse(input)
 return Object.keys(inputJson).map((key) => {
 return (JSON.stringify([key, inputJson[key].input]));
});
""";
```

14 . Click on the `Run` button. After successful execution a new Routine will be created with name `JsonObjectKeys` (refer image below)

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32592458/212664014-f6f114ce-6677-4b86-a360-bf801280985d.png)

15 . Go back to DataStudio and follow the same steps as we did for Flat fields (9 to 11) above for `Flow Results` data source. (Replace the **Dataset ID** as per your setup in 2 lines.)

16 . For Contact Collection. Again go to your BigQuery account. Open a new tab and run below query. Replace `tides-saas-309509.917302307943` with your **Dataset ID**

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32592458/212663971-569e3848-7a8a-44ff-813a-f044962c3397.png)

```
BEGIN
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW
  `tides-saas-309509.917302307943.contact_collection` AS (
  SELECT
    name,
    phone,
    group_name
  FROM
    `tides-saas-309509.917302307943.contacts`,
    UNNEST(SPLIT(group_labels, ',')) group_name);
END
```

17 . Click on the `Run` button. After successful execution a new Routine will be created with name `contact_collection` (refer image below)

<img width="1470" alt="Image 4" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/119285990/217206706-0a8d37e6-ef58-46d5-b4e1-0a4ba458bcff.png" />

18 . Go back to DataStudio and follow the same steps as we did for `contacts` (6 and 7) above to connect the `Contact Collection` data source.

19  . **Masked Phone Numbers**
<img width="1028" alt="Screenshot 2024-09-16 at 3 21 29 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6fa394c8-768d-4ac5-88df-1aa65793762c">

If you want to reveal the phone numbers in your dashboard
