**Glific currently supports the use of `Tags`, which is used for categorizing flows, HSM Templates & Interactive Messages. Tags help you manage your flows/ templates/ interactive messages faster and enables you to filter out and view items belonging to each Tag separately, making the search process easier.**

## Tags in Flows 

<img width="742" alt="Screenshot 2023-09-15 at 7 12 33 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/132430123/268149081-d3143ab5-1ceb-42d5-bb32-e15a66c4c0fb.png"/>

In the Flow listing page, you will find the option for selecting a Tag from a dropdown list. Tags could be helpful for bundling all flows which are similar to each other.

Tags could be created during the creation of a flow. Please refer the screenshot below :

As you can see, while creating a flow, you can either select a Tag from the dropdown or create a new Tag which indicates the type of Flow. Here since it is a user registration flow, we’re tagging it as ‘Onboarding’. Similarly, other Tags could be used like ‘Support’, ‘Menu’ for bundling all flows which handle support or which contain menu respectively.

## Tags in HSM Templates

Tags could also be useful in HSM Templates, for bundling all similar template messages. 
As you can see in the screenshot above, the Tag option could be found just above the `Submit for Approval` option.

Similar to what we saw in `Tags in Flows`, during Template message creation, Tags could either be created or selected from the available set of options. It can also be ignored if not required.

As you can see, on choosing the `Weather` tag, we are able to filter out all HSM templates which are tagged as ‘Weather’. Since only one template is tagged as ‘Weather’, just the template we just created is being shown. In this way, you will be able to categorize & at a later stage, search & find templates easily by making use of `Tags`.

## Tags in Interactive Messages

Tags can also be used in Interactive Messages. It will particularly be useful for categorizing interactive messages which has some common attributes. This makes finding them at a later stage useful. 

Tags could either be selected from a dropdown or a new Tag could be created altogether while creating an interactive message. 

<img width="1257" alt="Screenshot 2023-09-15 at 7 54 23 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/132430123/268154907-36e3968b-efda-40ab-81f5-5033271f803d.png"/>

In the screenshot above, we can see that the interactive message we’re creating is tagged with a new tag called ‘Registration’. So when you’re searching for the Tag at any later point, you’ll be able to find it out easily without scrolling over the whole Interactive Message listing page. Tags make sure that you end up categorizing similar interactive messages to the same bucket, bringing a structure in the flow listing page, improving the searchability & helps managing them easier.

## Note
It is important to note that selecting or creating tags are not mandatory during creation of a Flow, Template or Interactive Message. It is an additional feature in case you’ve large number of flows/ templates/ interactive messages & managing them becomes cumbersome.
