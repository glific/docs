## Bulk Import and Update Contacts

Glific offers two key features to help manage contacts efficiently:

- Import Contacts (Add new contacts in bulk)
- Move Contacts (Update contact fields or add contacts to a collection)

These tools are especially helpful during onboarding, data migration, or large-scale updates.

### 1. Import Contacts

#### When to Use

Use the Import Contacts feature when you need to add new contacts in bulk into the Glific Platform.

**For example:**

- Onboarding a new group of users.

- Migrating from another CRM system.

- Adding participants for an upcoming campaign or event.

#### How to upload contacts in bulk

#### Steps

1) Login to `Glific Platform`. 

2)  In the left panel navigate to `Manage` and select `Contacts`

3) Find the `Import` contacts(left side) and click Continue.(as shown in the below image)

4) Download the sample csv and provide the information of the contacts in the format of the sample csv(as per the below screenshots)

<img width="546" height="462" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c29d6a05-0c83-4757-be93-303ee9b1cdf5" />

<img width="530" height="444" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/44453c95-17b7-4c44-922b-f32d360563f0" />

9) Check the notifications page to see the status of the upload.

### Important Notes
    
- Ensure that the country code is present in the phone number without `+`

- This feature uploads all the contacts into the platform and does not validate the phone number (if it is less than 10 digits or if the number exists on WhatsApp or not). Any invalid number which gets added, when broadcasted to, will not get the message.

- Language field is to provide the language preference. Leaving it blank will cause the language preference to be the default language selected in the org’s Glific platform.

- Contacts blocking the chatbot can lower your quality rating with Meta.

- Always import in small batches to avoid message delivery issues or account flagging.


### 2. Move Contacts (Bulk Update)

#### When to Use

#### Use the Move Contacts feature to:

- Add existing contacts to specific collections
- Update custom contact fields (e.g., language, location, group, status)

#### This is especially useful when:

- Used to segment users for campaigns (e.g., surveys, reminders)

- Used to update location, interest, or status based on recent interactions.

- Used to tag contacts by region or type (e.g., Maharashtra Contacts, Grade).

- Can be used for bulk updates without creating duplicate contacts.
