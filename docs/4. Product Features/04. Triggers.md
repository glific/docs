## Triggers

Triggers allow scheduling flows to be sent to contacts in a collection automatically. This is useful for reminders, announcements, surveys, or follow-ups without needing manual intervention.

**Example use cases:**

- Sending weekly program updates to users.
- Reminding contacts to submit an activity or attend an event.
- Running monthly feedback surveys to a specific location group.

## When to Use Triggers ?

Use triggers when there is a need to send messages automatically to a group of contacts at scheduled intervals.

Example: To send a reminder every Monday at 10 AM to a Training Participants collection.

## Prerequisite:

- The flow should be created and published.
- Ensure the first message in the flow is an HSM template message

2. Click on `+ Create` button.

3. Select the flow to be scheduled from the dropdown.

4. Set the start date( date from when you want to start a flow) and end date.((end date should be greater than the start date)

6. Choose the repeat option:

- Daily: Runs every day at the chosen time.
- Weekly: Runs only on selected weekdays.

Q: Can the trigger be paused instead of deleted?

Ans: No, triggers cannot be paused. They can only be deleted.

Q: Can multiple triggers use the same collection?

## Important Notes:

- Ensure flows start with an HSM message for reliable delivery to contacts outside the session window.
- Deletion is the only way to update an existing trigger.
- Always test a trigger on a sample group before using it in production.
- Multiple triggers can use the same collection, but ensure they are set to run at different times. This is recommended to avoid conflicts.
