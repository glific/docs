  ## Extract Data by Flow from BigQuery:

- The following query can be used to extract data by flow.

```sql
WITH extracted_json AS (
  SELECT
    contact_phone,
    contact_name,
    JSON_EXTRACT_SCALAR(results, '$.feedback_positive.input') AS feedback_positive,
    JSON_EXTRACT_SCALAR(results, '$.result_q1_pos.input') AS result_q1_pos,
    JSON_EXTRACT_SCALAR(results, '$.result_q2_pos.input') AS result_q2_pos,
    JSON_EXTRACT_SCALAR(results, '$.result_q3_pos.input') AS result_q3_pos
 FROM
    `your_project.your_dataset.your_table`  where uuid = "flow_uuid"
)
SELECT * FROM extracted_json;
```

- All flow results must be added in a similar manner:

`JSON_EXTRACT_SCALAR(results, '$.flow_result.input') AS flow_result,`

- Running the query will generate a table displaying phone numbers, names, and their flow results, which can then be exported as a CSV.
