**HSM (Highly Structured Message) templates are pre-approved message formats required for sending outbound messages to contacts outside the 24-hour WhatsApp session window.
These templates help ensure compliance with WhatsApp’s policies and are commonly used to send notifications, alerts, or support messages.
Templates can include placeholders for personalized content and are essential for initiating conversations once the 24- hour session window has expired.**

---

Session Window - A session window refers to the 24-hour period following a user's initial interaction with your business on WhatsApp. During this time, you can send unlimited messages to the user without additional costs. If the user doesn't respond within that window, you must wait for them to initiate contact again or use a pre-approved message template to reach out.This mechanism ensures that businesses can engage with users promptly while maintaining compliance with Meta's messaging policies.

## When to Use HSM Templates:

**Use them for:**

- For initiating conversation with the contacts after the 24-hour session window is closed, such as sending reminders or important follow-ups.

- For broadcasting standardized updates, like activity schedules, weather alerts, crop advisories, appointment confirmations, service announcements,programs and events

- Call to action buttons: Add a Call to Action (CTA) button in an HSM (template) message when the recipient is expected to take a specific action directly from the message.

<img width="506" height="387" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/460cf615-e772-41ce-a837-babddce2e5e7" />

- There are two main options:

  - **Phone number** and **URL**.

  - **Note:-** Phone numbers without country code (for example Exotel numbers) will be added in HSM as an `Call to actions` option. As a workaround, you can add these numbers in the body of the message.

  - If selected **URL**, must choose between **Static** and **Dynamic** links.

Here's a simple explanation with examples:

**Static URL**

- A Static URL is a fixed link. It will be the same for everyone who receives the message.

- Use it when the link doesn't change.

**Example:**

- Sending a message about online training. The requirement is that all users visit the same registration page.
  Button Title: Register Now

- Button Value: `https://xyz.org/register`

- All users will see the button “Register Now” and clicking it will take them to `https://xyz.org/register`

**Dynamic URL**

- A Dynamic URL changes for each user. Personalize the link by adding contact-specific data (like name, ID, or custom fields).

- Use it when the link includes unique details per user.

**Example:**

- Send a personalized health report to each user.
- Button Title: View Report.
- Button Value: `https://xyz.org/report/{{1}}`

- Sample Suffi- x: 12345 (so the full link becomes `https://xyz.org/report/12345`)

- When sent, `{{1}}` will be replaced by the user's specific ID, like 12345 or abc678.

j. `Category` - Select the most relevant category from the dropdown. Ex. Utility or Marketing.

- Utility: Used for transactional messages to keep your customers in the loop with essential order updates, shipping status, about their accounts, orders, appointment reminders, and important alerts.

- Marketing: Elevate your brand by sending promotional content, announcing new products, and offering special deals to captivate your audience. For instance, promotional messages, including special offers, product launches, and loyalty programs

k. `Attachment type` - Select the attachment type to send an attachment in your HSM template message Ex. Image, Audio, Video, etc.

l. `Attachment URL` - Paste the attachment URL ( public URL) from the GCS bucket. Refer [Upload files on GCS](https://glific.github.io/docs/docs/Pre%20Onboarding/GCS%20Setup/Upload%20files%20on%20GCS/#upload-media-files-in-the-gcs-bucket)

## How to use HSM Templates in your flows

Common messages used in flow are session messages, which are open to send only within the 24 hours of users sending a message. If beneficiary responds within 24 hours, the session remains active. After 24 hours NGO users cannot send messages on chat bot to the beneficiary, until they send some message from their WhatsApp.

Remaining hours of session messages expiry can be checked from contact list under search section in left pane.

WhatsApp provides HSM templates which can be sent after the 24 hours. These templates needs to be approved from WhatsApp before they can be used in the conversation.

## Approve Multi-lingual HSM templates

Glific has added a support to apply HSM messages for multiple templates by obtaining approval under the same element name.
When the templates are already approved, simply add it in the default language, and other languages will be automatically tagged since the element name remains consistent.

Steps 1: Create and Approve English Template

1.  Click `Create Template.`
2.  Fill in the template in English, with a unique element name.
3.  Choose category (e.g., Utility, Marketing).
4.  Submit the template for approval.
5.  Wait until it is approved by WhatsApp.

**English**

<img width="519" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/29764c5c-80c9-487c-bbe2-857b86c0486b"/>

Step 2: Create the Template in Another Language (e.g., Hindi)

1.  Click `Create Template.`

2.  Select `Language Variant` from the drop-down.

    <img width="519" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/918237e0-6b73-42fc-b7a2-33bc4803e542"/>

3.  Choose the target language (e.g., Hindi).

4.  Important: Check the `Translate existing HSM` box.

    <img width="519" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/29300f35-8e13-4e3a-a8bd-8d0d8bc54028"/>

    <img width="519" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5dfd616b-eb38-4896-a730-16abf2e44d15"/>

    _This reveals a dropdown of element names from already approved HSM templates._

5.  Select the same element name as the English template (e.g., multi_lingual_hsm_test).

6.  Alternatively, Enter the same Element Name as the approved English version. (_This links both templates under the same template family_)

7.  Input the translated version of the HSM message in Hindi

8.  Submit for approval.

**Hindi**

<img width="499" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4b76dc4a-ae76-4473-91af-1e1650799c34"/>

Step 3: Repeat for Other Languages (Optional)

1.  Follow Step 2 for additional languages (e.g., Marathi, Kannada, Tamil).

2.  Always ensure:
    Same element name
    Accurate translation
    Matched placeholders

Note: Now when adding the template in flow, you can add English template in default language flow. If contact selects a different language (Hindi), then the Hindi version of HSM will be send to the contact. It chooses the language specific HSM automatically based on the selection of language by the end-user.

<br />

## Suggestions to get the HSM template approved

1. **Avoid doing** - Hi, here are the activities for today. We hope you complete them by the end of the day and submit them.
1. **Instead do** - Hi @nameofperson, following are the activities we have assigned for you and we hope you can complete them and submit them by the end of the day. Thank you.
1. Keeping the **_messages personal and interactive_** with an old beneficiary helps in the approval of the HSM template.
1. GCS **_attachments link should be public_** and working for the beneficiary to access it.
1. **_Use absolute URL_** in HSM text. Short URLs don&#39;t work and the template got rejected with an error message &quot;Invalid format&quot;
1. **Emojis are not allowed** in HSM buttons. If you add emojis the template will be rejected.
1. **GIFs are not allowed** in HSM attachments. If you add Gifs as an attachment, it will be rejected.
   <br />

**Note** - The HSM templates need to be in one language. Do not mix the languages in one template (Ex. words of both English and Hindi language should not be in one HSM template).
