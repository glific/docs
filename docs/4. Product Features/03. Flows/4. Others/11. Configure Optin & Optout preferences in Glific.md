# Opt-in & Opt-out Flows


**When any new beneficiary sends a message for the very first time,  the beneficiary can get an Optin message  to give their consent to receive the messages from the BOT. Likewise, the beneficiary also has the freedom to Optout from receiving anymore messages from a Whatsapp Chatbot.**

To update consent status on any user,Update Contact→Settings—>Optin/ Optout in the flow.
A dropdown named `Consent status` (replacing "Settings") which will further give you 2 options as a dropdown- Opt In & Opt Out. Functionality at the backend remains the same.

Please note- There wouldn’t be any issues in the flows in which you updated the consent status using “Settings” earlier. It will work fine without any issues.

## Opt-out preferences update

5 .  Create a flow for opt-out or use the existing flow in the system. Keywords for Optout flow could be  **optout**, **stop.** _(You can recommend us if you have better suggestions for the keywords)_

6 .  When beneficiary sends    **optout** or **stop**  keyword to BOT, Opt-out preferences will be set for the beneficiary.

7 . Yon need use **optout** value to update the `Consent status` variable .




**Note** - Make sure to use optin as keyword of this flow. optin is a special keyword which will execute the flow to get contact&#39;s optin even if they are optedout

## What happens if a user has opted out and then opts in?

If a contact has previously opted out and then need opts back in

- The user needs to send the specific keyword like optin,start,hi which is associated to the flow which captures optin and saves it in update contact node.

- By sending the associated keyword that particular opt-in flow will get started, even though the contact was previously marked as invalid.
