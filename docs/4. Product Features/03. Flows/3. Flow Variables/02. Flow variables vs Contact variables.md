# Flow variables vs Contact variables


In flow editors, users can use two types of variables to store and reuse data:
- Flow Variables (`@results`) - Can be used only on a particular flow.
- Contact Variables (`@contact`) - Can be used across all flows.

Choosing between them depends on whether users need the data just for the current flow or across multiple workflows.

If users want to use the variables in the same flow, use flow variables(@`results`) or if the users want to use it across multiple flows, use contact variables(`@contact.fields`) 

---

## Using Flow Variables (`@results`)

Flow variables are used when users want to store and use information only within the same flow.

### Steps:

1. Add a `Wait for Response` node in the flow.
(Users can also use flow variables in the `Save Flow Result` node and in the `webhook node`)
2. Give the response a Result Name (e.g., `contact_email`).
3. Do not use uppercase letters, special characters, or spaces. The underscore (_) can be used as a substitute for spaces.

4. Access the variable using:
- `@results.contact_email` - to show the exact response.
- `@results.contact_email.category` - to show the categories.

Use the variable in the Send Message node or other nodes within the same flow.

### Example: 
Sample workflow to get graduate students to register for advanced classes.


<img width="1034" height="578" alt="Screenshot 2025-10-08 at 1 18 23 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f61d613c-b4b5-4143-9d50-e5e55a7d436d" />


In the given example, the contact information has been captured in the below variables (note the ‘wait for response’ blocks). This will show the value of the variables entered by the end user in the flow.
In the given Registration Flow, user can capture:
- `@results.contact_name`
- `@results.contact_email`
- `@results.college_name`
- `@results.college_year`

This allows you to personalize the conversation immediately, like:
“Hi `@results.contact_name`, thank you for registering!”

If user wants to show the category of the variable, then you can use category in 
- `@results.contact_name.category`
- `@results.contact_email.category`
- `@results.college_name.category`
- `@results.college_year.category`

In the example below Male is categorised as `M`, Female is categorised as `F`, Other is categorised as `O`.

## Using Contact Variables (`@contact`)
Contact variables are used when the users want to use the variable across all flows.

### Steps:
1. Use an `Update Contact` node to save a value in a contact field.

<img width="467" height="263" alt="Screenshot 2025-10-08 at 1 24 50 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cf80bb0c-5f56-4c5f-9a8f-a546a74909d2" />



2. Access this value later in any other flow using: `@contact.fields.collegename`

Example:
In the given below example - survey workflow, it’s been created to get the feedback of the students
In this workflow, the feedback and sending the responses back to the end user who has participated in the survey has been captured. The contact information which was saved in the Registration workflow can also be fetched here and used in the responses.


Contact information is fetched with the below syntax for required variables:
- `@contact.fields.contactname`
- `@contact.fields.email`
- `@contact.fields.collegename`
- `@contact.fields.collegeyear`


<img width="913" height="578" alt="Screenshot 2025-10-08 at 1 28 45 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c27343b7-ff79-446c-a012-c485dec22a34" />


This allows you to say:
“Hi `@contact.fields.contactname`, we value your feedback on the advanced classes.”
Or 
“Thanks for your feedback `@contact.fields.contactname`”

### Best Practices

- Use Flow Variables (`@results`) for  data within the same workflow.
- Use Contact Variables (`@contact`) for storing data which can be used across flows.
- Keep variable names simple, lowercase, and without spaces (use underscores) for result variables.
- Prefer contact variables for data like registration details, preferences, or identifiers.
