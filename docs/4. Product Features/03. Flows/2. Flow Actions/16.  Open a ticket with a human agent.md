**Support tickets streamline the process of managing user queries by allowing to create tickets directly from flows and assign them to human agents for resolution.**


## When to use this feature.

Use the Open Ticket to Human Agent feature when queries need to be streamlined and assigned to human agents for faster resolution. This is particularly useful in cases where:

- The chatbot is unable to resolve or answer the user’s query.

- System-level issues occur, such as webhook or Google Sheet failures, where automated handling is not possible.

## Steps to Open a Ticket
 
**1. Start the Flow**

Create or open an existing flow where you want to handle user queries.
The first step is to prompt the user to submit a query.
 
- **Example:**
 Use a Send Message node to ask:
 `Please enter your query, and our team will get back to you shortly.`
 
**2. Capture the User’s Query**

Next, use the Wait for Response node to capture the user’s input.
- Assign a Result Name such as a query.

- This stores the user’s response so it can be used to populate the ticket body later.

- If the result name is changed (e.g., query_text), then you must use @results.query_text in the ticket body. Always use the result name of the Wait for Response node to avoid errors.

**3. Add the Open Ticket node in the flow**

- Select Open a ticket with a human agent from the dropdown.

 - Add Labels – such as Query,Registration, Support, or Feedback.

- Why: Labels help filter and categorize tickets for easier management later.

- Assign a Staff Member – choose the team member who will resolve this ticket.

- Why: Direct assignment ensures queries go to the right team without delay.

- Ticket Body – use the captured response, e.g., @results.query.

- Tip: This ensures the ticket contains the exact query submitted by the user.

- Click OK to save the node.

**4. Add a Send message node to Success (as shown on the above screenshot)**

- Send a message to the end users  like `I am connecting you to a support agent for further help” to let the user know their query is being escalated`

**5. Add a Send message node to Failure (as shown on the above screenshot)**

 
- If for some reason the ticket cannot be created (e.g., system outage), the chatbot can log the error and notify the admin team.

- **Example:** Webhook or Google Sheet integration fails → ticket escalation ensures no query is lost.


**6. Publish the flow.**

- Test the flow to ensure that:

- Tickets are created.

- Staff members receive the assigned ticket.


# View Support Ticket Inquiries

All tickets will display with the following columns:

- `ID`: Unique ticket number.


- `Created At`: When the ticket was created.


- `Issue`: User’s query.


- `Opened By`: Which user logged the ticket.


- `Topic`: Category/subject of the ticket.


- `Status`: Open (Pending) or Closed (Resolved).


- `Assigned To`: Staff member handling the ticket.

- `Actions`: Provides options to add remarks, change the assignee or status of the ticket. Actions also include a 'Send message' which can be used for navigating to the exact point in chat where the ticket was created. This enables you to easily navigate to the part of the conversation where the ticket creation happened. This helps in avoiding the manual scroll required for identifying the exact location of the chat where the query was raised by a user. It also helps with more context regarding the intent of the user for raising the query.

### Bulk Update

- Updating the status of the tickets could be updated together or in bulk by using the ‘Bulk Update’ option on the top right corner of ‘Tickets’ page

<img width="1410" alt="image" src="https://github.com/glific/docs/assets/143380171/50804083-ac04-46eb-a6d5-9d8530ed12e1"/>

<img width="1457" alt="Screenshot 2024-02-29 at 2 29 49 PM" src="https://github.com/glific/docs/assets/143380171/73446c3a-2d50-47d4-8b34-7d09ff213aeb"/>


- You can close all the tickets from a particular ‘Topic’ together by clicking on the ‘Close Tickets’ button. This will be particularly useful when you deal with tickets from a particular topic together and reduces the manual effort required for opening every ticket and closing them one by one.

### Search & Filter

Searching for an individual ticket or group of tickets can be done using : 
a. Body of the ticket
b. Phone number of the user
c. Name of the user

This search could be used for easily segregating tickets based on a user or the type of  query. By searching using a phone number or name, you will be able to view all the tickets raised by a particular user. Likewise, by searching for a particular keyword inside the body, you will be able to view all the tickets which have the same keyword. In this way, the support person will be able to handle similar queries & queries from the same user together. The enhanced search also enables the support person to prioritize/ de-prioritize the tickets based on a user or query type.

### Add Remarks

Once a ticket is created, users can make edits by utilizing the `Add Remark` option. These features allow for easy ticket management and efficient resolution.
