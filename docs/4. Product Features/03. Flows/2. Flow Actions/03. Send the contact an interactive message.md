Interactive messages allow users to send messages containing interactive elements such as buttons and list menus or collect location, enabling their end users (chatbot users) to engage in dynamic and engaging conversations. <br />
This functionality is particularly useful for:
<ul>
  <li>Enhancing the end user experience: By allowing interaction through buttons or lists, the effort required from the end user to type responses is reduced.</li>
  <li> Supporting NGOs in data collection: Interactive messages help gather cleaner, structured data that can be easily categorized and validated.</li>
</ul>

It is important to note that platform users must first create an interactive message following the steps outlined <a href="#section1">here</a>. Only after this step can the message be used within the flow editor, where it can be configured as part of a chatbot flow. <br />

<h2 id = "section1"> Type of Interactive Messages: </h2>
<ol>
<li>Reply Buttons -  This type of interactive message enables the user to include up to three clickable buttons or options within a single message</li>
  <img width="438" height="236" alt="Screenshot 2025-10-09 at 1 03 56 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/050c74f6-c6df-4daf-b92e-96dc519c9e54" />
  <br />
  Important Guidelines:
  <ul>
    <li>Using Emojis: Emojis can be included in the buttons or responses of an interactive message. If emojis are used, ensure that the entire string, including emojis, is copied from the interactive message and pasted in Wait for Response. Only the “phrase” option in Wait for Response should be used to match the complete string for a valid response. For more details, refer to the <a href="https://glific.github.io/docs/docs/Product%20Features/Flows/Flow%20Actions/Wait%20for%20the%20contact%20to%20respond">Wait for Response</a> documentation.</li>
    <li> Character Limit: According to Meta’s guidelines, each button can contain a maximum of 20 characters. For example, a phrase like “Yes I want to participate” (26 characters) cannot be used, as it exceeds the limit. </li>
    <li> Markdown Restrictions: Markdown characters such as <code>*</code>, <code>_</code> are not allowed in interactive message buttons. Using them will trigger an error: “Character policy violated” (see screenshot). </li>
    <br />

  </ul>

  
<li>List message - This type of interactive message allows the platform user to present up to 10 options or choices in the form of a list within a message. </li>
  <br />
  Important Guidelines:
  <ul>
    <li>Using a list introduces additional steps for the end user: the first click opens the list, the second click selects an option, and the third click confirms and sends the selection.</li>
    <li>Emojis are not allowed in the title field of list options. Please avoid using them there.</li>
    <li>Meta has set character limits for list titles and descriptions—24 characters for titles and 60 characters for descriptions. Adhering to these limits is essential for interactive messages to function correctly.</li><br />

  </ul>

  
  <li>Location request - This type of interactive message allows the platform user to capture the location shared by the end user.</li><br />
  <img width="596" height="175" alt="Screenshot 2025-10-09 at 1 19 13 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/050591c5-583d-4c31-aa0f-8df00323dc34" /><br />
</ol><br />

All interactive messages follow the structure: Message body + interaction method (buttons, list options, or location share). An interactive message cannot consist solely of interaction options (buttons, list options, or location share) without a message body.

## How to add interactive messages in the flow editor:
Step 1. Create a flow.<br />
Step 2. While adding a new node, select Send the contact an interactive message action type.<br />
Step 3. Use dropdown to select the interactive message that you had previously created. You can also type the title of the interactive message that is to be used, to minimize the search in the dropdown.<br />

<h3 id="section3a">Using Interactive Messages in different languages</h3>
Please follow the steps below to create interactive messages with auto-translate functionality for different languages.<br />
Step 1: Create the interactive message in the default language using the steps mentioned here.<br />
Step 2: Once the interactive message is created in the default language, click on the ‘Translate’ button.<br />

<img width="637" height="322" alt="Screenshot 2025-10-09 at 2 00 29 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f2f1bc52-675b-4b3e-85f5-40d3ec5242aa" /><br />
A pop-up appears where selecting Auto translate the content in the message box will automatically translate into the already specified languages.<br />

<img width="634" height="343" alt="Screenshot 2025-10-09 at 2 01 03 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/533d3907-ae7a-4e45-a42b-53dd231089df" /><br />
Step 3: The message in the box, including the list header, list name, and options(and button options), will be translated into all specified languages. The language-specific interactive message will automatically execute for contacts who have set that particular language in their profile.

<img width="633" height="346" alt="Screenshot 2025-10-09 at 2 01 51 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0236450a-f56d-49a6-8de2-3022f19002f1" /><br />
Make sure to verify the translations added in the mentioned field, post auto translation<br />

Step 4: Click on the `SAVE` button<br />
Here's the link to the <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uiJQWIi-6U7YZu28OggvXSqZ57FYNudf/view?usp=drive_link">sample flow</a><br />
Please note- <br />
It is recommended to add translations when creating the interactive message. Alternatively, translations can be added manually later by updating the category and rule translations in the flow editor by switching languages. Adding translations during message creation—either using the auto-translate feature or manually—automatically populates the values in the category and rule translations.
