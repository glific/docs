- Track responses, feedback, or status updates.



## Configuring Readable Google Sheet in the Flow

1 . Create a new flow and open it for editing

2. Use `link Google sheet` node

3. Select `Link google Sheet`

4. In the second drop-down select the sheet

5. In `Select row` add any variable that uniquely defines the `Key` column of the linked Google sheet

<img width="505" alt="Screenshot 2024-02-29 at 1 47 48 PM" src="https://github.com/glific/docs/assets/141305477/f15cce2a-7882-4f83-901e-48b7d7bba09d" />

_As per above example, the sheet `Daily Activity` is used to read the content from, and the variable `@calendar.current_date`  D/MM/YYYY being passed from Glific to the Google sheet is being used as the search key to identify the relevant row to send the content from_ 

These all are the below calendar functions that can be used :
`@calendar.current_date`,`@calendar.yesterday`,`@calendar.tomorrow`,`@calendar.current_day`,`@calendar.current_month`,
`@calendar.current_year`

To write date and time, use the following expression:
`<%= DateTime.now!("Asia/Kolkata") |> Calendar.strftime("%Y/%m/%d %H:%M:%S") %>`

6. Click on `OK` 

7. Use column header like below and access the relevant column of the identified row.

`@results.sheet.col_nameA`

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32592458/219550825-82831f46-a239-4600-b95e-bf0533f0565b.png)


**Examples**

- Survey Submission: Write answers to a new row for each participant.
- Registration Forms: Save participant name, contact number, and event preferences.
- Attendance Logs: Record check-ins directly into the sheet.

## Send template messages using Google Sheets

Template messages could be sent using Google Sheets using `Read Google Sheets`. This is generally useful when different template messages need to be scheduled & sent regularly to the beneficiaries. 
Let us dive in a bit deeper by looking at the steps involved : 

1. Create the template messages that you'd like to send via Google Sheets using the normal method. Refer [Creating Template Messages](https://glific.github.io/docs/docs/Product%20Features/Templates/#hsm-template-creation--approval-submission)

2. Once the template is created, make note of the UUID of the template messages you need to share using Google Sheets. Refer the screenshot below :
 
<img width="1280" alt="Screenshot 2024-02-29 at 1 58 09 PM" src="https://github.com/glific/docs/assets/141305477/502a5e35-86dc-4770-819e-9c6d3292c526"/>

3. Create a Google Sheet with two headers, `Key` and `template_uuid` as shown below. Usually the `key` column will be having dates on which the individual templates need to be sent.
   <img width="730" alt="Screenshot 2023-09-15 at 1 25 33 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/132430123/268214931-e64e1019-ee86-49cc-8ec0-10d1d816d56d.png"/>
4. Now let us setup the flow. The flow starts with a `Link Google Sheets` node which has the Google Sheets we created linked. This is how the node looks like :
   
![Screenshot 2023-09-15 at 1 50 48 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/132430123/268221544-0320cd68-1fbd-42fb-9d98-fd3740acfe18.png)

As you can see, the row input field is given an expression `@calendar.current_date` which tries to match the current date value with a `Key` value. If a match is found, then that row is chosen.

5. In the next step, `Send contact a message` is used and an expression is given in place of the template selection drop-down. The expression reads <%= `Glific.send_template("@results.sheet.template_uuid", ["@contact.name"] ) %>` and if no variables then `<%= Glific.send_template("@results.sheet.template_uuid", [] ) %>`
   

   
In this expression, the `template_uuid` matching the row in the given date gets send to the user. The expression also passes the value of the contact's name. You can pass multiple variables in this expression, if the template message demands it, using comma separation.

In this way, you can use Google Sheets for sending template messages. With the use of [Triggers](https://glific.github.io/docs/docs/Product%20Features/Triggers/) you'll be able to schedule different template messages for specific dates using Google Sheets, enabling you to do it in a single flow, instead of creating separate flows for separate templates. This is particularly useful, when you plan to share a set of instructions/ advisory/ content in a scheduled manner in specific dates & let's you use dynamic content for the same.

## Send Interactive Messages using Google Sheets

Glific enables you to send interactive messages using Google Sheets. This is particularly helpful when you need the options within the interactive messages to be dynamic. 
This lets you use the same interactive message for creating multiple dynamic list of options to choose from for the beneficiary.

Let's dive in a bit deeper to see how it works.

1. Create a Google Sheet with the list of options you wish to have in the interactive message in a row as shown below. In this example, we want the values given in row 2 i.e `key` value as 1 to be used as the options in the interactive message we're going to create. These values could be updated in real-time to change the options inside the interactive message or you can add more rows to have different interactive messages too. 
<img width="1394" alt="Screenshot 2023-09-19 at 2 12 47 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/132430123/268894514-d5c4dd36-8f86-46a0-adb9-8688b1d1d791.png"/>

2. Add the above created Google Sheet on the Glific. Please find the steps to do that [here](https://glific.github.io/docs/docs/Product%20Features/Flows/Flow%20Actions/Link%20Google%20Sheets/#add-readable-google-sheet)

3. Now create a sample `Interactive Message` with a list message (can do similarly for button options too).
- Please note the first option needs to be entered as shown below with some sample data. This is to ensure the interactive message is created and saved. The list or options will be rewritten by the values on the sheet, hence the rest of the options could be left empty. 
  
<img width="1294" alt="Screenshot 2024-02-29 at 2 08 50 PM" src="https://github.com/glific/docs/assets/141305477/e5c8b2b4-c33f-4360-9f6d-ff14a76c12f3"/>

4. Now since we have the Google Sheets linked & the interactive message created, let's create a sample flow to understand how it works :
<img width="738" alt="Screenshot 2023-09-19 at 11 51 38 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/132430123/268859289-c3af33c5-8bc2-4eb0-96ff-d2d8aa4cba01.png"/>

5. As you can see, the flow starts with a Link Google Sheets node, where the readable google sheets from which the options to be fetched inside the interactive message is added. This is how the Google Sheets node is configured :
<img width="628" alt="Screenshot 2023-09-19 at 11 53 27 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/132430123/268859658-2780aa59-e56c-4b7d-aecf-9b55ff47496e.png"/>

- In the node above, the sheet we created have been linked & the corresponding action is marked as `Read` since the options for `Interactive Message` are being read from the Google Sheets.
- Here 1 is added in `Select row` field, as the values for the interactive message are present on the row with the key value as 1 and it is stored under the variable name `sheet`
- Instead of 1, you can also use dynamic values like [flow variables or contact variables](https://glific.github.io/docs/docs/Product%20Features/Flows/Flow%20Variables/Flow%20variables%20vs%20Contact%20variables), functions like @calendar.current_date etc.


6. The next node consists of `Send contact an interactive message` node and this is how it is configured
<img width="611" alt="Screenshot 2023-09-19 at 2 14 22 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/132430123/268894962-90c136b4-3775-426d-9962-269e7407feba.png"/>

- The interactive message we've created is chosen from the dropdown.
- The dynamic fields checkbox is selected which enables us to use dynamic values inside the interactive message.
- In the input field box with `number of variables`, the number of options in the interactive message needs to be entered. Here we've given 8, since we need 8 options in the list sent (as also shown on google sheets).
- The `id` and `variable` values need to be filled. The id could be any unique value for referencing & variable value is being fetched from the linked Google Sheet.
- The variable names are filled as `@results.sheet.course1`, `@results.sheet.course2` and so on representing each row value from the row we've chosen to read from.

7. Now since the flow is configured, let's test the flow
<img width="286" alt="Screenshot 2023-09-19 at 12 07 16 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/132430123/268862637-8919962e-840e-47dd-9865-919dd902b483.png"/>

As you can see on the preview above, the list of options we had given in the Google Sheets are shown as a list of options inside the Interactive Message.

- Sending interactive messages using Google Sheets could avoid the redundancy of creating multiple interactive messages when the list of options needs to be updated (some option needs to be added or removed) or multiple interactive messages to be used.
- It can also be used for handling situations where the list of options is more than 10 by using 'More' as the tenth option and having a separate list of options in the next row.

**Sample Flow**

[Write to Google Sheet.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/glific/docs/main/docs/3.%20Flows/3.%20Flow%20Features/write_to_sheet.json)


13. Here's how the imported flow would look like

<img width="589" alt="Screenshot 2024-02-29 at 2 40 13 PM" src="https://github.com/glific/docs/assets/141305477/2edeafc6-19fa-4241-9224-6dafdde84519" />


14. The first node is the `Send Message` node, which asks the contact for input to be added to the sheet.

15. The second node is the `Wait for Response` node with the result name sheet_input. The response from the contact will be saved in this result and can be referenced as `@results.sheet_input`.

16. The third node is the `Link Google sheet` node, used to add the user-entered text into the Google sheet. Click on this node to configure it.

<img width="627" alt="Screenshot 2024-09-25 at 10 53 03 AM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c5f6f422-91a0-48cb-bd98-bdb2d351fa6b"/>

17. Under Action, select `Write` from the dropdown menu.
18. From the next dropdown select the sheet which was added in the earlier step
19. Specify the name of the subsheet where the content needs to be written
20. Specify the starting cell to start writing from
