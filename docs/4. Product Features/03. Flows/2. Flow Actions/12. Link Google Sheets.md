**The Link Google Sheets action allows you to connect your flows in Glific directly to Google Sheets so you can read, write, and update data in real time.**

### When to use Read from Google Sheet

**Use this when you need to:**

- Send reminders, schedules, or event details stored in a central sheet.

- Populate lists or menus dynamically from sheet data.

### How to set Google Sheet:

- Google Sheets API is linked with Glific.

- The service account has Viewer or Editor access to the sheet.

- The sheet is shared with the service account email.


## Add Readable Google Sheet

1. Log in to your Glific account.

2. Click on `Flows` from the left panel and find `Google sheets`

3.  Click on `+Create` button to add a sheet to read from

<img width="1468" alt="Screenshot 2024-02-29 at 1 35 52 PM" src="https://github.com/glific/docs/assets/141305477/d0605089-b71e-41ba-85c2-593dabf49b40" />

4.  Add the `Sheet URL` and `Name` of the sheet which you want to integrate. Check the `Read` checkbox and Click on the`Save` button. Follow next steps to get the URL

<img width="413" alt="Screenshot 2024-02-29 at 1 38 46 PM" src="https://github.com/glific/docs/assets/141305477/2612f184-eb99-4e02-aca9-6b4c1adbec16"/>

5. Open the Google sheet and click on share button on the right hand side to update the sheet permission to at least `Anyone with the link` can `View`

7. Paste the copied URL in the Google Sheet Integration screen in Glific and click on `SAVE` button

8. You can click on the link button to open the added sheet

<img width="1298" alt="Screenshot 2024-02-29 at 1 42 44 PM" src="https://github.com/glific/docs/assets/141305477/1a1d5fcf-5d18-4ffe-bfa8-22f0ffabc5d3" />

- `It is important to note that the first cell in the Sheet should be named as 'Key' for the Read function to work.`


**Examples**

- Daily Reminders: Match today’s date to a schedule column and send the corresponding message.

- User Lookup: Pull registration details based on phone number or ID.

- Dynamic Menu: Read items from a sheet and send them as interactive list options.


### Why to use Write Mode of Google Sheet

Write Mode lets you send data from WhatsApp conversations directly into Google Sheets, removing the need for manual entry and ensuring immediate updates.

### When to use Write Mode

- Use this when you need to:
- Record survey answers in real time.
- Collect event registrations or sign-ups
- Track responses, feedback, or status updates.



## Configuring Readable Google Sheet in the Flow

1 . Create a new flow and open it for editing

2. Use `link Google sheet` node

3. Select `Link google Sheet`

4. In the second drop-down select the sheet

5. In `Select row` add any variable that uniquely defines the `Key` column of the linked Google sheet

<img width="505" alt="Screenshot 2024-02-29 at 1 47 48 PM" src="https://github.com/glific/docs/assets/141305477/f15cce2a-7882-4f83-901e-48b7d7bba09d" />

_As per above example, the sheet `Daily Activity` is used to read the content from, and the variable `@calendar.current_date`  DD/MM/YYYY being passed from Glific to the Google sheet is being used as the search key to identify the relevant row to send the content from_

**Note**: It is important to note that dates in the sheet should be in the format `DD/MM/YYYY`. Any other format will not work as expected. You could either set the Locale in the Google sheet to India or set the format of the column to `DD/MM/YYYY` here `Format -> Number -> Custom Date and Time`

These all are the below calendar functions that can be used :
`@calendar.current_date`,`@calendar.yesterday`,`@calendar.tomorrow`,`@calendar.current_day`,`@calendar.current_month`,
`@calendar.current_year`

To write date and time, use the following expression:
`<%= DateTime.now!("Asia/Kolkata") |> Calendar.strftime("%Y/%m/%d %H:%M:%S") %>`

6. Click on `OK` 

7. Use column header like below and access the relevant column of the identified row.

`@results.sheet.col_nameA`

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32592458/219550825-82831f46-a239-4600-b95e-bf0533f0565b.png)


**Examples**

- Survey Submission: Write answers to a new row for each participant.
- Registration Forms: Save participant name, contact number, and event preferences.
- Attendance Logs: Record check-ins directly into the sheet.

## Send template messages using Google Sheets

Template messages could be sent using Google Sheets using `Read Google Sheets`. This is generally useful when different template messages need to be scheduled & sent regularly to the beneficiaries. 
Let us dive in a bit deeper by looking at the steps involved : 

1. Create the template messages that you'd like to send via Google Sheets using the normal method. Refer [Creating Template Messages](https://glific.github.io/docs/docs/Product%20Features/HSM%20Templates/#hsm-template-creation--approval-submission)

2. Once the template is created, make note of the UUID of the template messages you need to share using Google Sheets. Refer the screenshot below :
 
<img width="1280" alt="Screenshot 2024-02-29 at 1 58 09 PM" src="https://github.com/glific/docs/assets/141305477/502a5e35-86dc-4770-819e-9c6d3292c526"/>

3. Create a Google Sheet with two headers, `Key` and `template_uuid` as shown below. Usually the `key` column will be having dates on which the individual templates need to be sent.
   <img width="730" alt="Screenshot 2023-09-15 at 1 25 33 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/132430123/268214931-e64e1019-ee86-49cc-8ec0-10d1d816d56d.png"/>
4. Now let us setup the flow. The flow starts with a `Link Google Sheets` node which has the Google Sheets we created linked. This is how the node looks like :
   
![Screenshot 2023-09-15 at 1 50 48 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/132430123/268221544-0320cd68-1fbd-42fb-9d98-fd3740acfe18.png)

As you can see, the row input field is given an expression `@calendar.current_date` which tries to match the current date value with a `Key` value. If a match is found, then that row is chosen.

5. In the next step, `Send contact a message` is used and an expression is given in place of the template selection drop-down. The expression reads `<%= Glific.send_template("@results.sheet.template_uuid", ["@contact.name"] ) %>` and if no variables then `<%= Glific.send_template("@results.sheet.template_uuid", [] ) %>`
   

   
In this expression, the `template_uuid` matching the row in the given date gets send to the user. The expression also passes the value of the contact's name. You can pass multiple variables in this expression, if the template message demands it, using comma separation.

In this way, you can use Google Sheets for sending template messages. With the use of [Triggers](https://glific.github.io/docs/docs/Product%20Features/Triggers/) you'll be able to schedule different template messages for specific dates using Google Sheets, enabling you to do it in a single flow, instead of creating separate flows for separate templates. This is particularly useful, when you plan to share a set of instructions/ advisory/ content in a scheduled manner in specific dates & let's you use dynamic content for the same.

## Send Interactive Messages using Google Sheets

Glific enables you to send interactive messages using Google Sheets. This is particularly helpful when you need the options within the interactive messages to be dynamic. 
This lets you use the same interactive message for creating multiple dynamic list of options to choose from for the beneficiary.

Let's dive in a bit deeper to see how it works.

1. Create a Google Sheet with the list of options you wish to have in the interactive message in a row as shown below. In this example, we want the values given in row 2 i.e `key` value as 1 to be used as the options in the interactive message we're going to create. These values could be updated in real-time to change the options inside the interactive message or you can add more rows to have different interactive messages too. 
<img width="1394" alt="Screenshot 2023-09-19 at 2 12 47 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/132430123/268894514-d5c4dd36-8f86-46a0-adb9-8688b1d1d791.png"/>

2. Add the above created Google Sheet on the Glific. Please find the steps to do that [here](https://glific.github.io/docs/docs/Product%20Features/Flows/Flow%20Actions/Link%20Google%20Sheets/#add-readable-google-sheet)

3. Now create a sample `Interactive Message` with a list message (can do similarly for button options too).
- Please note the first option needs to be entered as shown below with some sample data. This is to ensure the interactive message is created and saved. The list or options will be rewritten by the values on the sheet, hence the rest of the options could be left empty. 
  
<img width="1294" alt="Screenshot 2024-02-29 at 2 08 50 PM" src="https://github.com/glific/docs/assets/141305477/e5c8b2b4-c33f-4360-9f6d-ff14a76c12f3"/>

4. Now since we have the Google Sheets linked & the interactive message created, let's create a sample flow to understand how it works :
<img width="738" alt="Screenshot 2023-09-19 at 11 51 38 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/132430123/268859289-c3af33c5-8bc2-4eb0-96ff-d2d8aa4cba01.png"/>

5. As you can see, the flow starts with a Link Google Sheets node, where the readable google sheets from which the options to be fetched inside the interactive message is added. This is how the Google Sheets node is configured :
<img width="628" alt="Screenshot 2023-09-19 at 11 53 27 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/132430123/268859658-2780aa59-e56c-4b7d-aecf-9b55ff47496e.png"/>

- In the node above, the sheet we created have been linked & the corresponding action is marked as `Read` since the options for `Interactive Message` are being read from the Google Sheets.
- Here 1 is added in `Select row` field, as the values for the interactive message are present on the row with the key value as 1 and it is stored under the variable name `sheet`
- Instead of 1, you can also use dynamic values like [flow variables or contact variables](https://glific.github.io/docs/docs/Product%20Features/Flows/Flow%20Variables/Flow%20variables%20vs%20Contact%20variables), functions like @calendar.current_date etc.


6. The next node consists of `Send contact an interactive message` node and this is how it is configured
<img width="611" alt="Screenshot 2023-09-19 at 2 14 22 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/132430123/268894962-90c136b4-3775-426d-9962-269e7407feba.png"/>

- The interactive message we've created is chosen from the dropdown.
- The dynamic fields checkbox is selected which enables us to use dynamic values inside the interactive message.
- In the input field box with `number of variables`, the number of options in the interactive message needs to be entered. Here we've given 8, since we need 8 options in the list sent (as also shown on google sheets).
- The `id` and `variable` values need to be filled. The id could be any unique value for referencing & variable value is being fetched from the linked Google Sheet.
- The variable names are filled as `@results.sheet.course1`, `@results.sheet.course2` and so on representing each row value from the row we've chosen to read from.

7. Now since the flow is configured, let's test the flow
<img width="286" alt="Screenshot 2023-09-19 at 12 07 16 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/132430123/268862637-8919962e-840e-47dd-9865-919dd902b483.png"/>

As you can see on the preview above, the list of options we had given in the Google Sheets are shown as a list of options inside the Interactive Message.

- Sending interactive messages using Google Sheets could avoid the redundancy of creating multiple interactive messages when the list of options needs to be updated (some option needs to be added or removed) or multiple interactive messages to be used.
- It can also be used for handling situations where the list of options is more than 10 by using 'More' as the tenth option and having a separate list of options in the next row.

### Using G-sheets to Dynamically fetch button/list options in Interactive Messages.
This approach helps the user reduce the effort required to create flows containing multiple interactive messages by automatically fetching the message body and options from a Google Sheet.

It is particularly useful in scenarios such as:
<ul>
  <li> When multiple interactive messages (for example, more than 4) are used within a chatbot flow.</li>
  <li> When managing nested options (e.g., District → Block).</li>
</ul>

The example below demonstrates a sample setup for both approaches, which can be customized or adapted as per the specific use case.

<img width="314" height="428" alt="Screenshot 2025-10-09 at 2 31 36 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d67a4e0b-0cc4-4a14-8305-b4dca3959889" />

<ol>
  <li>In the nested drill-down approach, once the end user selects a district, the corresponding blocks under that district are displayed. </li>
  <li>In the second approach, based on the topic selected (Science or General Knowledge), a short quiz with two questions is presented to the end user. The message body and options for both questions are dynamically fetched from the G-Sheet. </li>
</ol>

#### Steps to configure this setup:
Step 1 - Setup the g-sheet, following this format. Here’s the link to the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16sG1O2DvLj_7z3m_uM-jGt_YPIiuoB_YXXCKdMeNbT8/edit?usp=sharing">sample sheet</a>

For quiz:

<img width="634" height="351" alt="Screenshot 2025-10-09 at 2 33 37 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/59331b13-3eb3-4a0d-92f3-15858dcbb2f7" />

To fetch district options from g-sheets– 

<img width="633" height="348" alt="Screenshot 2025-10-09 at 2 34 14 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7e3d4d6e-da91-41b8-9efc-eb7adb46fa2e" />

To fetch corresponding blocks, associated with the district—

<img width="633" height="335" alt="Screenshot 2025-10-09 at 2 34 49 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f846b2b0-e148-4195-8d80-140b91fc3ca4" />

Step 2: Integrate Google Sheet with Glific. For detailed steps on how this is done, please follow <a href="https://glific.github.io/docs/docs/Product%20Features/Flows/Flow%20Actions/Link%20Google%20Sheets/">this</a> link.

Step 3: Create the following interactive messages from `Quick tools` Pane:

For quiz - 

<img width="633" height="388" alt="Screenshot 2025-10-09 at 2 37 02 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/72bd2e3d-19d3-47d9-9fef-ad20969a72c1" />

For district options - 

<img width="590" height="356" alt="Screenshot 2025-10-09 at 2 37 23 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bd286914-aeb3-4b39-b887-66a72038b998" />

For block options - 

<img width="634" height="382" alt="Screenshot 2025-10-09 at 2 38 03 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/46051406-4806-4bcf-8357-646240a213f8" />

Since the options will be fetched dynamically from the G-Sheet, placeholder (dummy) values can be added as options while creating the interactive message(s).

Step4: Configure the flow, following the below mentioned requirements. Here’s the <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/14jFXXPkTiDKuzP3hVTXjYFeL0DKQ0dES/view?usp=drive_link">sample flow </a>

For quiz - 

<ul>
  <li>Since there are two topics, each containing two questions, a counter is initialized with a distinct starting value for each topic. After the first question is sent, the counter increments to fetch the next (and final) question along with its options.</li>
  <li> Once the counter is updated, a check is performed to confirm whether both questions have been delivered. If yes, the flow ends with a closing message; if not, the second question is sent.</li>
  <li>For the quiz, a single interactive message can be used, with its message body and options dynamically fetched from the linked G-Sheet.</li>
 
  <img width="383" height="391" alt="Screenshot 2025-10-09 at 2 43 25 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/13b7048f-6b1d-4741-bb22-d70efe8f18c0" />
  
  <img width="355" height="398" alt="Screenshot 2025-10-09 at 2 43 44 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/59ba324d-ba05-4a06-891c-5cd2db1c58a1" />
  
  <li> The <code>Use Dynamic Fields</code> option is enabled, and since only two options need to be shown to the user, the Read Option Limit is set to 2. Corresponding IDs and variable names are configured to fetch the option values from the correct columns in the linked Google Sheet. </li>
</ul>

For Nested drill down – 

<ul>
  <li> In the nested drill-down setup, district options are fetched from the linked G-Sheet. Based on the district selected by the end user, the corresponding blocks are presented as a second list for selection.</li>
 
  <img width="400" height="383" alt="Screenshot 2025-10-09 at 2 46 25 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4c60745c-0b44-4a00-89c5-ab9b2aa68986" />
  
  <img width="396" height="372" alt="Screenshot 2025-10-09 at 2 47 01 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/202c3127-9e68-40f6-ba9b-7e7a15c825fd" />
  
  <li> Sheet1 contains the district options, while Sheet2 contains the block options. Both sheets are configured separately within the flow.</li>
  <li>To ensure only the blocks associated with the selected district are displayed, the key value in sheet2 is set to <code>@results.district_captured</code>, which stores the district chosen by the end user. In the sheet containing the block values, each district serves as the key for its corresponding block list. </li>
  <li>Since only the options are being fetched from the linked G-Sheet, two interactive messages with a static message body are used.</li>
  
  <img width="458" height="505" alt="Screenshot 2025-10-09 at 2 51 24 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3b480b94-3865-4d1c-be01-9df01f5fc674" />
  
  <li> Since the number of blocks varies for each district, an additional column in the linked sheet stores the total number of options for every district. This allows the user to control the Read Options Limit and display only the necessary options. It also reduces effort when more options (up to 10) are added to the list, as only the value of <code>@results.sheet2.length</code> needs to be updated followed by syncing the sheet. </li>
</ul>



## Add Writable Google Sheet

### Enable Google Sheet APIs and Add Credentials

1. Use [this](https://console.developers.google.com/start/api?id=sheets.googleapis.com) wizard to create or select a project in the Google Developers Console. This will automatically turn on the API. Click Continue, then Go to credentials.

### Configuring Writable Google Sheet in the Flow

12. Import the below sample flow  from the Flow screen and click on `setting` icon to configure it.

**Sample Flow**

[Write to Google Sheet.json](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17AQ507LDoMx7-Us_fZxlvpOuKgDhV5AV/view?usp=sharing)


13. Here's how the imported flow would look like

<img width="589" alt="Screenshot 2024-02-29 at 2 40 13 PM" src="https://github.com/glific/docs/assets/141305477/2edeafc6-19fa-4241-9224-6dafdde84519" />


14. The first node is the `Send Message` node, which asks the contact for input to be added to the sheet.

15. The second node is the `Wait for Response` node with the result name sheet_input. The response from the contact will be saved in this result and can be referenced as `@results.sheet_input`.

16. The third node is the `Link Google sheet` node, used to add the user-entered text into the Google sheet. Click on this node to configure it.

<img width="627" alt="Screenshot 2024-09-25 at 10 53 03 AM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c5f6f422-91a0-48cb-bd98-bdb2d351fa6b"/>

17. Under Action, select `Write` from the dropdown menu.
18. From the next dropdown select the sheet which was added in the earlier step
19. Specify the name of the subsheet where the content needs to be written
20. Specify the starting cell to start writing from

<img width="608" alt="Screenshot 2024-09-25 at 10 57 35 AM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/910c2af7-b9c6-45d4-97a0-56611f097811"/>

20. Enter the data to be written in the Google sheet under Input data to update in sheet. You can use values like @results.sheet_input, @contact.name, @contact.fields.age, etc. This specifies the values to be written in the subsequent columns in the single row.

<img width="627" alt="Screenshot 2024-09-25 at 11 00 39 AM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/df7151bf-30b5-469a-9728-72d73d17156f" />

21. After configuring the flow, click on the `Preview` button located on the top right side of the screen to run the flow in the simulator.

23. In the simulator, you will see the first message from the `Send Message` node, which prompts you to enter text.

24. Type the desired text that you want to see in the sheet, and then press Enter.

<img width="845" alt="Screenshot 2024-02-29 at 2 36 46 PM" src="https://github.com/glific/docs/assets/141305477/c6d482ce-1419-4dc6-bbcd-2ecdf846dc6b" />
