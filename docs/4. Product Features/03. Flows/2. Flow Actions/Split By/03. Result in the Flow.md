# Split by Result in the Flow

In some flows, different paths are needed depending on the response of a previous question or node, those responses can be saved as result. The `Split by a result in the flow` node allows the flow to branch according to the value of this result.

To split the flow based on a result value, use the `Split by a result in the flow ` node.

## Example Use Case
Suppose you ask a question and want to send different responses based on the user’s answer. The Split by Flow Result node allows you to branch the flow and send customized messages according to their responses.

### Step 1: Capture user response in the flow
- Add a `Send Message` node that asks for user input.

### Step 2: Provide Result Name
- In the `wait for response` node, provide a result name (`color` is given as a result name in the screenshot given below)

### Step 3: Add a Split by Result node
Select the flow result variable from the dropdown(`@results.color`).

Define branches for each expected response value,for example:
- Branch 1 → Blue
- Branch 2 → Green

#### Step 4: Define specific responses
- Add messages or other nodes that correspond to the selected result.
- In the given example, users who responded with blue receive a message specific to blue, while users who responded with green receive a message specific to green.
