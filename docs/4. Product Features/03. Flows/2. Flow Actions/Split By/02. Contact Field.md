# Split by Contact Field

- There may be situations where a flow needs to display different responses based on a specific attribute of the contact, such as their age group, location, or registration type.
- These attributes are first stored in contact variables using the `Update Contact` node type. Once saved, the `Split by Contact Field` option can be used to check the stored value and guide the conversation along different paths in the flow.

Note: The end user’s response should be saved using the `Update Contact` node if you want to reuse a specific contact variable across different flows.

---

To split the flow based on a stored value, use the `Split by Contact Field` node.

## Sample Use Case

Suppose you want to make a decision based on the age group a contact belongs to. First, save the contact’s age in a contact variable. You can then use this variable in a Split by Contact Field node to branch the flow accordingly.


### Step 1: Collect the value
- Add a `Send Message` node that asks for the required attribute (for example, age or age group).

- In the wait for response node - select `has number` from the dropdown and provide a result name.

### Step 2: Save response to a contact field
- Add an `Update Contact` node
- Select what to update(users can create a new contact field here) and paste `@result.age` variable (age is the result name of  wait for response node in the given example)

### Step 3: Add a Split by Contact Field node
- Insert a `Split by Contact Field` node where branching is required.
- From the contact field dropdown, select the field saved in Step 2 (age).

Create a branch for each expected value. Example branches for age:
- Branch 1 → 1-12
- Branch 2 → 13-19
- Branch 3 → 20-60

### Step 4: Implement the logic
- Branch the flow separately for Kids, Teens, and Adults based on the age group split created using the `Split by Contact Field` node.
