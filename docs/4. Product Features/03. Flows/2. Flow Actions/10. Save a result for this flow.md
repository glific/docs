### Save a result for this flow:

It means storing the output or outcome of a specific flow run. This is useful for tracking user responses or decisions.
<br/>

## How to Create a Save Flow Result in Glific:

1. `Add a New Step`:

   - In your flow, add a new node after collecting user input.

2. `Select "Save Flow Result"`:

   - Choose the Save Flow Result option from the dropdown.

3. `Configure the Result`:

   - `Result`: Enter a unique name (e.g., user_rating).

   - `Value`: Use an expression like @(input) to save the user's response.

   - `Category` (Optional): Add a category like Rating.

4. `Save` and `Continue`:

   - Click `OK` to save the configuration and proceed with the next step in your flow.

This step allows you to store specific data when a contact reaches a particular point in a flow.

1. `Result`:

   - Enter a unique name for the result, which you can reference later using `@results`.
   - You can either select an existing result or create a new one.

2. `Value`:

   - Specify the value to be saved for the result.
   - You can use expressions to dynamically set the value, like @(title(input)).
   - Leaving this blank clears any previous value.

3. `Category` (Optional):
   - Use this to categorize the result, e.g., if the value is 17, the category might be Young Adult.

### `Example 1`:

- If a flow collects a user's feedback rating as "4", you can save the result as feedback_rating with the value 4.
  You can then use `@results.feedback_rating` in subsequent steps to reference this value.

You want to collect user satisfaction ratings (1 to 5) after a support interaction.

**Flow Steps:**

1. Ask for Feedback:

   - Send a message:
     "How would you rate your experience with us on a scale of 1 to 5?"

2. Capture User Input:

   - Use a "Wait for Response" to collect the rating.

3. Save the Result:

   - Use the "Save Flow Result" with the following configuration:
   - Result: user_rating
   - Value: @(input) (to capture the response)
   - Category: Rating (optional)

4. Acknowledge:
   - Send a thank-you message:
     "Thank you for your feedback! Your rating of @results.user_rating is noted."

**How It Works:** - When the user responds with a number (e.g., "4"), it gets saved as user_rating with a value of 4. - You can use @results.user_rating later in the flow for analysis or follow-up.

### `Example 2`:

    - Want to gather registration details, including preferred sessions and dietary preferences.

**Flow Steps:**

1. Welcome Message:

   - Send a message:
     "Welcome to our upcoming virtual event! Let’s get you registered. Could you share your name?"

2. Capture Name:

   - Use Wait for Response to get the user’s name.

3. Save the Name:

   - Use Save Flow Result with the following configuration:
   - Result: user_name
   - Value: @(input)
   - Category: Registration

4. Ask for Session Choice:

   - Send a message:
   - Which session are you most interested in? Options: Tech Innovations, Social Impact, Career Growth.
   - Use Wait for Response to capture the choice.

5. Save the Session Choice:

   - Use Save Flow Result with the following configuration:
   - Result: session_preference
   - Value: @(input)
   - Category: Event Details

6. Dietary Preferences (for On-site Attendees)- Check Attendance Type:

   - Send a message:
     Will you be attending virtually or on-site?
   - Use Wait for Response to get the answer.

7. Save Attendance Type:

   - Use Save Flow Result with the following configuration:
   - Result: attendance_type
   - Value: @(input)
   - Category: Event Details

8. Conditional Question:

   - If @results.attendance_type is "On-site", proceed to Step 9.
   - If "Virtual", skip to Step 11.

9. On-site Specific Information- Ask for Dietary Preference:

   - Send a message:
     Please let us know your dietary preference: Vegetarian, Non-Vegetarian, Vegan.
   - Use Wait for Response to collect the preference.

10. Save Dietary Preference:

    - Use Save Flow Result with the following configuration:
    - Result: dietary_preference
    - Value: @(input)
    - Category: Event Details

11. Send a personalized message:

    - "Thank you, `@results.user_name`! You are registered for the event. You have chosen the @results.session_preference session and will be attending @results.attendance_type. @if(@results.attendance_type == 'On-site') Your dietary preference is @results.dietary_preference."

**How It Works**:

- This flow dynamically adapts to whether the user is attending virtually or on-site.

- The data collected can be used to send personalized event reminders and follow-up messages, making the experience more tailored and efficient.
