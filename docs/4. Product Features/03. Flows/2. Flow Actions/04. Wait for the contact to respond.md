# Wait for the contact to respond 

The Wait for Response node is used whenever the flow needs to pause and collect an answer from the end user. It ensures the conversation continues only after the contact replies, making it useful for registrations, surveys, quizzes, and feedback collection.

Once the response is received, it can be validated, stored in a variable, and reused later in the same flow or across different flows.

Note: the contact variable can be used across flows, but the result variable is limited to the same flow.

## Why use Wait for Response?

- Conducting surveys or quizzes.
